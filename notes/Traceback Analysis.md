aims to identify the production and distribution chain of a product suspected on epidemiological and microbiological grounds to be the vehicle of a foodborne outbreak @weiser.etal2016

Traceback Analysis depedns on what we find out
- Horn on Food Suuply Network on macro level - goal find producer
- Weiser on collected data, but better tool for it - goal find any actor in the SC; but have to collect data for it before



# Traceback Data
Authorities may need to reconstruct relevant food distribution network to identify a causative food product. 
- [c] time consuming
- [c] labor-intensive as information has to be collected from each company involved in the affected product chain
c
IT-based traceability solution which support the tacking of food items in food business operations and which have existed for several years, are not mandatory 
- companies may sotre data in arbitrary formats, including non-digital formats, making compiling and analyzing data difficult 
- information of food deliveries may be collated by different public authorities, leading to data errors (e.g. different or misspelled names may be assigned to the same company or product)

Input: 
- Automatically generated semi-filled Excel Templates that can be sent to local authorites for data completion and afterwards be imported in the database
- a direct interface to the database for manual data input 


Advantages 
- capable of storing SC of indefinite length and arbitrary compelxity
- products can be "produced" in varying numbers of intermediate steps and be derived from one to any number of ingredietns 
- works with a "Tracing score" where a higher scrore for a station or delivery, the more likely a contamination of a commodity at a specific station or delivery can explain the outbreak 

- basically a tool for handling tracing data before - doing tracing manually
