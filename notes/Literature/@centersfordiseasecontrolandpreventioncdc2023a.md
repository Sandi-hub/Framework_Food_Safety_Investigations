- CDCâ€™s national laboratory network for detecting bacterial enteric (intestinal) disease outbreaks
- Most of its data consist of [[Pulsed-Field Gel electrophoresis]] subtyping analysis, although globally and in Canada since 2017 PFGE has been replaced by [[Whole Genome Sequencing|WGS]] (secondary source [[CardimFalcao_ReviewMicrobiologicalSource_2024|Cardim Falcao et al. (2024)]])
