> [!Abstract]- 
**Abstract::** Reducing the burden of foodborne salmonellosis is challenging. It requires identiﬁcation of the most important food sources causing disease and prioritization of effective intervention strategies. For this purpose, a variety of methods to estimate the relative contribution of different sources of Salmonella infections have been applied worldwide. Each has strengths and limitations, and the usefulness of each depends on the public health questions being addressed. In this study, we reviewed the source attribution methods and outcomes of several studies developed in different countries and settings, comparing approaches and regional differences in attribution estimates. Reviewed results suggest that illnesses and outbreaks are most commonly attributed to exposure to contaminated food, and that eggs, broiler chickens, and pigs are among the top sources. Although most source attribution studies do not attribute salmonellosis to produce, outbreak data in several countries suggest that exposure to raw vegetables is also an important source. International travel was also a consistently important exposure in several studies. Still, the relative contribution of speciﬁc sources to human salmonellosis varied substantially between studies. Although differences in data inputs, methods, and the point in the food system where attribution was estimated contribute to variability between studies, observed differences also suggest regional differences in the epidemiology of salmonellosis.

# Notes

Methods used in source attribution / to estimate the relative contribution of different food sources to human foodborne disease 
1. Microbiological
	- **Microbial subtyping approach**: compare the subtypes of isolates obtained from different sources (e.g. animals, food) with those isolated from humans
	- **Comparative exposure assessment:** determine the relative importance of the know transmission routes by estimating the human exposure to the hazard via each route

2. Epidemiological Approaches
- **Epidemiological analysis of sporadic cases-control studies:** determine risk factors for illness, including sources and behavioral factors, and population-attributable fractions (PAFs) are used to estimate the proportion of illnesses attributable to each source
- **Analysis of data from outbreak investigations:** quantify the relative contribution of different food to outbreak illnesses

3. Expert elicitation: 
- maybe used to fill data gap, to combine data from different studies and scientific approaches into a single estimate or as an alternative source-attribution method when other methods are not feasible or useful to address a public health question
