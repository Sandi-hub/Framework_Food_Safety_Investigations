**Abstract::** Hypothesis generation is a critical, but challenging, step in a foodborne outbreak investigation. The pathogens that contaminate food have many diverse reservoirs, resulting in seemingly limitless potential vehicles. Identifying a vehicle is particularly challenging for clusters detected through national pathogen-specific surveillance, because cases can be geographically dispersed and lack an obvious epidemiologic link. Moreover, state and local health departments could have limited resources to dedicate to cluster and outbreak investigations. These challenges underscore the importance of hypothesis generation during an outbreak investigation. In this review, we present a framework for hypothesis generation focusing on 3 primary sources of information, typically used in combination: 1) known sources of the pathogen causing illness; 2) person, place, and time characteristics of cases associated with the outbreak (descriptive data); and 3) case exposure assessment. Hypothesis generation can narrow the list of potential food vehicles and focus subsequent epidemiologic, laboratory, environmental, and traceback efforts, ensuring that time and resources are used more efficiently and increasing the likelihood of rapidly and conclusively implicating the contaminated food vehicle.

3 primary sources of information for generating hypotheses, typically used in combination 
## Know Pathogen Sources
Known sources of the pathogen causing illness
### Known Reservoirs
- Pathogens with a **human** reservoir 
  e.g. [[Norovirus]], [[Hepatitis A]] virus, [[Shigella]]) are commonly associated with infected food handlers or ready-to-eat food that have been contaminated with human feces
- Pathogens with **animal** reservoirs 
  e.g. Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli ([[Escherichia coli|STEC]]), nontyphoidal [[Salmonella]] and [[Campylobacter]] are often associated with food sources of animal origin or food that have been contaminated by animal feces during production (e.g. fresh produce)
- Pathogens with **environmental** reservoirs 
  e.g. Vibrio spp., [[Listeria]] monocytogenes, [[Clostridium]] botulinum are commonly associated with food that can become contaminated by soil or water

**Tools that help identify know pathogen sources:** 
- [@centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdc2022c] - NORS
- [@foodanddrugadministrationfda2012] - Bad Bug Book
- [@centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdc2013] - Atlas of Salmonella

### Food Pathogen Pairs
provide information on common food vehicles associated with a pathogen
#### Foods (and animals) implicated in past outbreaks
The [@interagencyfoodsafetyanalyticscollaboration.etal2019] estimated the proportion of illnesses of Salmonella, Escherichia coli 0157, Listeria Monocytogenes and Campylobacter to 17 major food categories
![[@interagencyfoodsafetyanalyticscollaboration.etal2019#Pathogen - food classification]]


#### Findings from case-control studies of sporadic illnesses
i.e., diagnosed cases investigated during routine surveillance not linked to other cases
- [[Campylobacter]] and poultry [@friedman.etal2004]
- [[Listeria]] monocytogenes and melons and hummus [@varma.etal2007]

### Molecular subtyping information of the pathogen 
 - Using information that distinguishes isolates of the same species by **phenotypic or genotypic characteristics**
	- Example: different serotypes of [[Salmonella]] enterica are predominantly associated with specific food sources [@jackson.etal2013]
- **Antimicrobial resistance** is also useful in differentiating 
	- Example: differentiating major sources of [[Salmonella]] serotypes found in both animal- and plant-derived food commodities
	- antimicrobial resistant [[Salmonella]]outbreaks were more likely to be associated with meat and poultry (.e.g beef, chicken and turkey), whereas foods commonly associated with susceptible [[Salmonella]] outbreaks were eggs, tomatoes and melons [@brown.etal2017]
- [[Pulsed-Field Gel electrophoresis|PFGE]] patterns have been associated with specific foods (sources 15 & 16)
- **Subtyping of nonhuman isolates** (i.e. food, animal, or environmental sources) collected by regulatory agencies from food and food chain environments through routine testing or special studies can lead to the identification of outbreaks of human illness by searching the PulseNet database for the same molecular subtypes in human infection, sometimes referred to as "backward" outbreaks.
	- Example [@sotir.etal2009, p. 201]
		- in 2007 public health authorities were investigating a multistate outbreak of [[Salmonella]] serotype Wandsworth in which patients reported consuming a puffed vegetable coated snack food. Food testing yielded the outbreak strain Salmonella serotype Wandsworth, but it also yielded Salmonella serotype Typhimurium
		- A Search in [[@centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdc2023a|PulseNet]]database identified matching isolates from human cases of Salmonella serotype Typhimurium infection and these cases confirmed consumption of the same snack food upo re-itnerview 
## Descriptive Data
Descriptive data = Person, Place and Time  characteristics of cases associated with the outbreak
### Person
Sex, Age Race, Ethnicity can suggest food that are more likely to be eaten by certain groups. 
#### Sex
- **Example**: the median percentage of female cases in vegetable associated [[Escherichia coli#Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC)|STEC]] outbreaks was 64%, compared with 50% in beef STEC outbreaks [@white.etal2016]
- Similar trends in the CDC FoodNet Population Survey: women reported consuming more fruits and vegetables than men, and men reported consuming more meat and poultry. [@shiferaw.etal2012]
#### Age
**Example**: Lowest median percent of children and adolescents in vegetable associated STEC outbreak and the highest in STEC diary outbreaks. [@white.etal2016]

### Time
shape and pattern of an epidemic curve (provides more relevant information as the outbreak progresses)
- can indicate the shelf life of a product or the harvest duration of a contaminated field 
- For example: 
	- cases spread over a **longer time period** might suggest a shelf-stable or frozen food item, ongoing harborage of the contaminating pathogen in a food processing plant or other sustained mechanism of contamination 
	- cases with illness onset dates spread over a **limited duration** of time might suggest a perishable item, such as fresh produce 
- Caveat: some fresh produce items have longer shelf lives than other and can cause more protracted outbreaks 
- Caveat - special cases: outbreaks associated with sprouted seeds or bean which have a short shelf life, are typically driven by a single contaminated seed lot, and un-sprouted seeds and beans can have a shelf life of months to years
	  -> single batches might be sprouted from the same contaminated lot of seeds at different times and in different places 
	  -> longer outbreaks, temporally and geographically distinct outbreaks 
	- Example: [@ferguson.etal2005]

### Place
- Comparing the distribution of cases with the distribution pattern of that food item [@tauxe1997]) #research/pattern_comparison 
	- **Widespread outbreaks** are caused by widely distributed commercial products and some foods are more likely to be distributed nationally: e..g bagged leafy greens, packaged cereal, national meat brands
	- **Regional outbreaks**: e.g. popular brands of ice cream
	- **Local outbreaks**: e.g. raw milk

- If some outbreak-associated illnesses are related to **travel** to a specific country and others are in nontravelers, it suggests that the latter might be associated with a product imported from that country
	- Example: In a 2011 multistate outbreak in the United States, a subset of cases traveled to Mexico and ate papaya there, and nontravel-associated cases ate papaya imported from Mexico  [@mba-jonas.etal2018]
	- there is another example of an outbreak related to papaya from Thailand but <span style="background:rgba(240, 107, 5, 0.2)"> I couldn't verify this exact information on the source provided</span>
### Outbreak Size and Distribution
outbreak size and distribution can suggest certain food-pathogen pairs
- seafood toxins like ciguatoxin are typically produced or concentrated in an individual fish --> cause illness in a limited number of people in a signle jurisdiction
- Salmonella and other bacterial pathogens can contaminate large amount of a widely distributed product [@tauxe1997]

- The distribution of cases can be misleading or incomplete early in an outbreak
- An apparently local outbreak can be an early indicator of a larger problem
- Example in 2018, a large multistate outbreak of [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] O157:H7 infections linked to romaine lettuce was initially detected in New Jersey in association with a single restaurant chain; within 8 days of detecting the cluster it had expanded to include many more cases with a variety of different exposure locations as far away as Nome, Alaska. 
  (<span style="background:rgba(240, 107, 5, 0.2)">I couldn't verify this exact information on the source provided</span>)

## Case Exposure Assessment
- usually done via different types of interview with the cases
- additionally methods
- analysing consumer food purchase data [@moller.etal2018]
- using information from services for grocer home delivery, restaurant take-out delivery and meal kits
- Binomial probability comparison: comparing the proportion of cases in an outbreak reporting a food exposure with the expected background proportion of the population reporting the food exposure [@jervis.etal2019]

## Discussion & Limitations
- types of outbreaks for which hypothesis generation is inherently more challenging: 
	- outbreaks for which the vehicle has a high background rate of consumption (e.g. chicken)
	- outbreaks associated with "stealth" food (e.g. garnishes, spices, chilli peppers or sprouts) that many cases could have consumed, but few remember eating
	- outbreak that are caused by multiple contaminated food products when, for example
		- multiple food have a single common ingredient
		- poor sanitation or contaminated equipment leads to cross-contamination 
	- the key exposure might not be a food at all, but rather an environmental or animal exposure
- helpful things: 
	- cases with 
		- restricted diets
		- food diaries
		- highly unusual or specific exposures (e.g. cases who traveled briefly to the outbreak location and thus had limited number of exposures)
	- smaller, localized clusters within a larger outbreak associated with restaurants, events, stores or institutions, or "subclusters" are often crucial to hypothesis generation
		- Example: In a multistate outbreak of [[Salmonella]] serotype Typhimurium infections associated with consumption of tomatoes, comparison of 4 restaurant-associated subclusters was instrumental in rapidly identifying a small set of potential vehicles [@behravesh.etal2012]
- [[Whole Genome Sequencing|WGS]] might give investigators more conviction in devoting resources to following leads because there is more confidence that the cases have a common source for their illnesses [@besser.etal2019; @jackson.etal2016]

> In a foodborne outbreak, the hypothesis states which food vehicle(s) could be the source of the outbreak and warrant further investigation. In practice, hypothesis generation is dynamic and iterative. It begins in the earliest stages of an investigation as investigators review available information and look for a pattern or “signal” that might emerge. As more information becomes available hypotheses are frequently evaluated and refined.
