# Notes
%% begin notes %%
- The data came from 1,329 foodborne disease outbreaks that occurred from 1998 through 2017 and for which each confirmed or suspected implicated food fell into a single food category
- The method relies most heavily on the most recent five years of outbreak data (2013 â€“ 2017)
- Foods are categorized using a scheme IFSAC created to classify foods into 17 categories

## Pathogen - food classification
- [[Salmonella]] illnesses came from a wide variety of foods: seeded vegetables (such as tomatoes), Chicken, Fruits, Pork, Eggs, Other Produce (such as nuts) and Beef
- [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] 0157 illnesses were most often (75%) linked to Vegetable Row Crops (such as leafy greens) and Beef 
- [[Listeria]] illnesses were most often (75%) linked to Dairy products and Fruits
	- the rarity of Listeria monocytogenes outbreaks makes these estimates less reliable than those for other pathogens
- Non-Dairy [[Campylobacter]] illnesses were most often (neatly 80%) linked to **Chicken**, other Seafood (such as shellfish), Turkey and Other Meat / Poultry (such as lamp or duck)
