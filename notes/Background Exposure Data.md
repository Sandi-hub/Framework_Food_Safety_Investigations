refers to pre-existing statistical information about the general population's exposure to specific factors, such as food consumption. In the context of [[Binomial Trial|binomial testing]] during outbreak investigations, this data is essential for estimating the probability that the observed number of cases who have been exposed to a suspected source (e.g., a specific food item) occurred by chance alone.

- [[POS Data]]
- [[Exposure data from sporadic cases and past outbreaks]]
- [[Population-based food consumption surveys]]
