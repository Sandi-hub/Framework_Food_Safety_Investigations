This is the standard way. The goal is to find some evidence for a common exposure, e.g. consumption of a certain food item in a defined time period before disease onset or a locations that was visited by all cases (restaurant, hospital, ... ) 

> Exposures should be prioritized based on: 
> 1. The likelihood that the exposure is truly the exposure of interest for a case-patient; 
> 2. The availability of clear, documented details on the exposure (e.g., receipts, shopper card information, bank statements); 
> 3. Whether or not other case-patients share specific commonalities (e.g., ate at the same restaurant, shopped at the same grocery store, report the same brand or variety of the suspect food item); 
> 4. Geographic and/or temporal dispersion of case exposures; 
> 5. The likelihood that a case exposure (single case or subcluster) represents a different “leg” in the supply chain that might provide convergence upstream; and 
> 6. The likely quality of the product tracing information available at the suspect exposure location
