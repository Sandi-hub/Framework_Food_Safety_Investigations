In order to trace (i.e. estimate the source) an outbreak on a [[Food Supply Network]] there are different algorithms. 

@brockmann.helbing2013 & @manitz.etal2014

- @brockmann.helbing2013 developed the network-geometric approach
- @manitz.etal2014 apply it to foodborne diseases snd evaluate application to the 2011 outbreak of STEC in sprouts
- single-path assumption 
- replace the geographic distance by an effective distance measure that is derived from the topological structure of the underlying food distribution network

@jacobs.etal2020
- apply the approach of @manitz.etal2014 to various outbreaks in the Netherland to identify scenarios for which the method does not work 
- difficulties when detailed information on food distribution was unavailable and the gravity model is used to  approximate flow between nodes.

@horn.friedrich2019
- framing contamination diffusion as a random walk on a network that accounts for all possible paths contamination could travel instead of the most probable or shortest path
- demonstrated improvements in identifying outbreak sources through simulations and application to the 2011 E. coli outbreak in Germany
