- If the pathogen is known, question in [[Food Consumption History informed by interviews|interviews]] can focus on foods and other risk factors known to be associated with the particular pathogen 
- Knowledge of the incubation period of the pathogen can point to the most likely period of exposure or identify an unusual event or a suspect meal.
- In protracted outbreaks, when investigating illnesses with incubation periods longer than 72 hours (e.g. [[Hepatitis A]], typhoid fever, listeriosis) or when a person does not remember specific foods eaten, questions should be asked about food preferences, i.e. foods usually eaten or routine dietary habits. Information should also be obtained about foods purchased during the incubation period of the disease under suspicion.
