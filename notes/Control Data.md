	- not available at daytime
	- not reachable via landline @jervis.etal2019
- [c] controls are not willing to participate in studies 
	- low response rates lead to concerns regarding selection bias (those reached might not be representative of the general population @jervis.etal2019

-> Pre-established panels of consenting participants have recently been used to recruit control
- [p] require less human, time, and financial resources compared to classical control recruitment methods @luczynska.etal2023, p.1

	-  271 participants, who volunteered to answer health and hygiene-related online questionnaires regularly @perriat.etal2022
 -> Pre-collected [[Data from Market Research Panels]] or other sources are sometimes directly used to understand exposure prevalence in the population. @gillespie.etal2010
