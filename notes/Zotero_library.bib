  abstract = {Several reasons have contributed to the prolonged neglect into which the study of statistics, in its theoretical aspects, has fallen. In spite of the immense amount of fruitful labour which has been expended in its practical applications, the basic principles of this organ of science are still in a state of obscurity, and it cannot be denied that, during the recent rapid development of practical methods, fundamental problems have been ignored and fundamental paradoxes left unresolved. This anomalous state of statistical science is strikingly exemplified by a recent paper entitled "The Fundamental Problem of Practical Statistics," in which one of the most eminent of modern statisticians presents what purports to be a general proof of BAYES' postulate, a proof which, in the opinion of a second statistician of equal eminence, "seems to rest upon a very peculiar -- not to say hardly supposable -- relation."},

This study assessed the impact of direct economic losses and indirect economic consequences due to this outbreak. The economic impact of the outbreak was estimated to be about 82,686,000 yen. The laboratory costs, about 21,204,000 yen, showed the highest ratio of the total cost of this outbreak (about 26\%). Also, the cost of foodstuffs that were not purchased during the suspension of the lunch service (about 19\%), personnel expenses paid to lunch service employees (about 17\%), human illness costs (about 15\%), and the repair costs of facilities (about 15\%) showed up as a high ratio in the total cost, respectively. Because all patients were children, the productivity losses estimated were low as children were considered as dependants with no income. Instead, we estimated the lost income of the mothers of the children. The source of the contamination could not be identified. Therefore, no food industries suffered any setbacks where certain food items could not be used for daily consumption due to the outbreak.},

In this article, we present a mathematical model that depicts foodborne disease transmission to humans by cockroaches to incorporate control interventions such as insecticides use and regular environmental sanitation. The mathematical and numerical analyses are conducted to investigate the impact of these control interventions when considered as a single or combined strategies. The results reveal the efficacy level of the insecticides beyond which a total eradication is possible. Use of baits and trapping devices intervention is also explored and revealed to be the best.},

Today, AI is widely used to assist research and development in industrial biotechnology. Many biotech firms rely on AI tools. The food industry is among the industrial sectors where AI has only recently been explored. AI enhances food biotechnology by supporting food enzymes engineering, microbial metabolic engineering, food safety and, in general, food microbiology. The use of AI tools in the food industry ranges from food processing -- including all aspects of the production of food ingredients -- to food quality and safety. This paper highlights the emerging importance of AI in some specific sectors of food biotechnology: development of new process-aid enzymes, precision fermentation, food safety and toxicity, food microbiology, and the study of the interplay between food and gut microbiome. These represent only a few examples of the myriad of applications that AI is seeing and will see in the food biotech sector.

While a number of studies have examined individual-level risk factors for COVID-19, few studies have examined geographic hotspots and community drivers associated with spatial patterns in local transmission. The objective of the study is to understand the spatial determinants of the pandemic in counties across the U.S. by comparing socioeconomic variables to case and death data from January 22nd to June 30th 2020. A cluster analysis was performed to examine areas of high-risk, followed by a three-stage regression to examine contextual factors associated with elevated risk patterns for morbidity and mortality. The factors associated with community-level vulnerability included age, disability, language, race, occupation, and urban status. We recommend that cluster detection and spatial analysis be included in populationbased surveillance strategies to better inform early case detection and prioritize healthcare resources.},

We will describe the impact of foodborne diseases in public health, the reservoirs of foodborne pathogens (the environment, human and animals), the main bacterial pathogens and food vehicles causing human diseases, and the drivers for the transmission of foodborne diseases related to the food-chain, host or bacteria features. The implication of food-chain (foodborne pathogens and commensals) in the transmission of resistance to antibiotics relevant to the treatment of human infections is also evidenced. The multiplicity and interplay of drivers related to intensification, diversification and globalization of food production, consumer health status, preferences, lifestyles or behaviors, and bacteria adaptation to different challenges (stress tolerance and antimicrobial resistance) from farm to human, make the prevention of bacteria-food-human transmission a modern and continuous challenge. A global One Health approach is mandatory to better understand and minimize the transmission pathways of human pathogens, including multidrug-resistant pathogens and commensals, through food-chain.},

  abstract = {Campylobacteriosis is among the world's most common foodborne illnesses, caused predominantly by the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni. Effective interventions require determination of the infection source which is challenging as transmission occurs via multiple sources such as contaminated meat, poultry, and drinking water. Strain variation has allowed source tracking based upon allelic variation in multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) genes allowing isolates from infected individuals to be attributed to specific animal or environmental reservoirs. However, the accuracy of probabilistic attribution models has been limited by the ability to differentiate isolates based upon just 7 MLST genes. Here, we broaden the input data spectrum to include core genome MLST (cgMLST) and whole genome sequences (WGS), and implement multiple machine learning algorithms, allowing more accurate source attribution. We increase attribution accuracy from 64\% using the standard iSource population genetic approach to 71\% for MLST, 85\% for cgMLST and 78\% for kmerized WGS data using the classifier we named aiSource. To gain insight beyond the source model prediction, we use Bayesian inference to analyse the relative affinity of C. jejuni strains to infect humans and identified potential differences, in source-human transmission ability among clonally related isolates in the most common disease causing lineage (ST-21 clonal complex). Providing generalizable computationally efficient methods, based upon machine learning and population genetics, we provide a scalable approach to global disease surveillance that can continuously incorporate novel samples for source attribution and identify fine-scale variation in transmission potential.},

The method is an extension of Berman \& Turner's (1992) device for maximizing the likelihoods of inhomogeneous spatial Poisson processes. For a very wide class of spatial point process models the likelihood is intractable, while the pseudolikelihood is known explicitly, except for the computation of an integral over the sampling region. Approximation of this integral by a finite sum in a special way yields an approximate pseudolikelihood which is formally equivalent to the (weighted) likelihood of a loglinear model with Poisson responses. This can be maximized using standard statistical software for generalized linear or additive models, provided the conditional intensity of the process takes an `exponential family' form. Using this approach a wide variety of spatial point process models of Gibbs type can be fitted rapidly, incorporating spatial trends, interaction between points, dependence on spatial covariates, and mark information.},

Most of the studies are focused on some diseases (for example, tuberculosis, salmonellosis, and brucellosis), but there are few studies on other diseases which are not officially controlled but also have an impact on the economy. This work is a systematic literature review on models (as a theoretical scheme, generally in mathematical form) used in the epidemiological analysis of bovine infectious diseases in the dairy farming sector. In this systematic literature review, criteria were defined for cattle, models, and infectious diseases to select articles on Scopus, IEEE, Xplorer, and ACM databases. The relations between the found models (model type, function and the proposed objective in each work) and the bovine infectious diseases, and the different techniques used and the works over infectious disease in humans, are presented. The outcomes obtained in this systematic literature review provide the state-of-the-art inputs for research on models for the epidemiological analysis of infectious bovine diseases. As a consequence of these outcomes, this work also presents an approach of EiBeLec, which is an adaptive and predictive system for the bovine ecosystem, combining a prediction model that uses machine-learning techniques and an adaptive model that adapts the information presented to end users.},

The model comprises 51 commodity groups from farm to fork differentiating three different temperature ranges as well as living animals. Spatially, it works on an aggregate level of 402 regions within Germany as well as its 50 most important trading nations. It determines the commodity flows and the additionally needed transport capacity in case of disruptions. Showing how changes in production, inventories, sourcing, and consumption affect commodity flows, the model uncovers vulnerabilities and makes risk evaluation possible.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

A large body of research addresses violence at school; however, fewer studies have explored concentrations of violence in areas proximal to schools. This study aimed to quantify the concentration of shootings near schools to elucidate the place-based dynamics that may be focal points for violence prevention. Geocoded databases of shooting and school locations were used to examine locational patterns of firearm shootings and elementary, middle, and high schools in Boston, Massachusetts. Analyses utilized spatial statistics for point pattern data including distance matrix and K function methodology to quantify the degree of spatial dependence of shootings around schools. Results suggested that between 2012 and 2015, there were 678 shooting incidents in Boston; the average density was 5.1 per square kilometer. The nearest neighbor index (NNI\,=\,0.335~km, p\,{$<$}\,.001, O\,=\,0.95~km, E\,=\,0.28~km) and G function analysis revealed a clustered pattern of gun shooting incidents indicative of a spatially non-random process. The mean and median distance from any school to the nearest shooting location was 0.35 and 0.33~km, respectively. A majority (56\%, 74/133) of schools in Boston had at least one shooting incident within 400~m, a distance that would take about 5~min to walk if traveling by foot. The bivariate K function indicated that a significantly greater number of shootings were clustered within short distances from schools than would be expected under a null hypothesis of no spatial dependence. Implications for students attending schools in racially homogenous neighborhoods across all income levels are discussed.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION An outbreak of shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli infections occurred in southwest France in June 2012. The outbreak was investigated to identify the source of infection, and guide control measures. METHODS Confirmed outbreak cases were patients who developed bloody diarrhoea or haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) between 28~May and 6~July 2012, with E.~coli O157 isolates showing indistinguishable patterns on pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A standardized questionnaire was administered to patients to document food consumption and other risk exposures. Their purchase was checked through their supermarket shopper card data. RESULTS Six patients (four with HUS and two with bloody diarrhea) were confirmed outbreak cases. Fresh ground beef burgers from one supermarket were the only common food exposure, identified by interviews and shopper card data. The PFGE profile of shiga toxin-producing E.~coli O157 isolated from the suspected beef burgers was identical to those from the human cases. The suspected beef burgers were no longer on sale at the time of investigation but three patients confirmed as outbreak cases had deep-frozen some at home. CONCLUSION Shopper card data was particularly useful to obtain precise and reliable information on the traceability of consumed food. Despite the expired use-by date, a recall was issued for the beef burgers. This contributed to preventing other cases among consumers who had deep-frozen the beef burgers.},

The model ranks pathogen-food combinations according to five measures of societal burden. FIRRM incorporates probabilistic uncertainty within a Monte Carlo simulation framework and produces confidence intervals and statistics for all outputs. Gaps in data, most importantly in regards to food attribution and the statistical uncertainty of incidence estimates, currently limit the utility of the model. Once we address these and other problems, however, FIRRM will be a robust and useful decisionmaking tool.},

  abstract = {The expansive learning curve literature in Operations Management has established how various facets of prior experience improve average performance. In this paper, we explore how increased cumulative experience affects performance variability, or consistency. We use a two-stage estimation method of a heteroskedastic learning curve model to examine the relationship between experience and performance variability among paramedics at the London Ambulance Service. We find that for paramedics with lower experience, an increase in experience of 500 jobs reduces the variance of task completion time by 8.7\%, in addition to improving average completion times by 2.7\%. Similar to prior results on the average learning curve, we find a diminishing impact of additional experience on the variance learning curve. We provide an evidence base for how to model the learning benefits of cumulative experience on performance in service systems. Our findings imply that the benefits of learning are substantially underestimated if the consistency effect is ignored. Specifically, our estimates indicate that queue lengths (or wait times) might be overestimated by as much as 4\% by ignoring the impact of the variance learning curve in service systems. Furthermore, our results suggest that previously established drivers of productivity should be revisited to examine how they affect consistency, in addition to average performance.},

  abstract = {Little is known about how people-centric factors affect the shape of service time distributions, despite distributional statistics (variance or quantiles) being key drivers of system performance in many service industries. We investigate the impact of one people-centric factor---worker fatigue---on the average, variance, and quantiles of service times in paramedic operations. Our analysis uses data on the performance of 368,634 paramedic teams in the London Ambulance Service over 10 years. We measure fatigue by the number of prior jobs a paramedic crew has completed during a shift and estimate its impact on the time it takes the crew to respond to incidents and bring patients to hospitals. Using a re-centered influence function regression approach with multiple fixed effects, we find that the average time to hospital increases by 5\% throughout the course of an average shift. In addition, the workers become less consistent with fatigue: service time variance increases by 39\% during a normal shift. Furthermore, we find that in addition to an upward shift in mean service times, both the upper and lower tails of the distribution have more weight for fatigued paramedics. These effects are mostly driven by the performance of paramedics at the scene, rather than their driving to or from the incident. The distributional effects of fatigue are only slightly mitigated by increased experience or reduced system workload. Our work demonstrates that the impact of people-centric factors can be highly non-uniform across the service time distribution.},

In the UK and many other countries in the Global North, a significant proportion of cases are caused by the consumption of imported food products or contracted during foreign travel, therefore, making the rapid identification of the geographical source of new infections a requirement for robust public health outbreak investigations. Herein, we detail the development and application of a hierarchical machine learning model to rapidly identify and trace the geographical source of S. Enteritidis infections from whole genome sequencing data. 2313 S. Enteritidis genomes, collected by the UKHSA between 2014--2019, were used to train a `local classifier per node' hierarchical classifier to attribute isolates to four continents, 11 sub-regions, and 38 countries (53 classes). The highest classification accuracy was achieved at the continental level followed by the sub-regional and country levels (macro F1: 0.954, 0.718, 0.661, respectively). A number of countries commonly visited by UK travelers were predicted with high accuracy (hF1: {$>$}0.9). Longitudinal analysis and validation with publicly accessible international samples indicated that predictions were robust to prospective external datasets. The hierarchical machine learning framework provided granular geographical source prediction directly from sequencing reads in~{$<$}4~min per sample, facilitating rapid outbreak resolution and real-time genomic epidemiology. The results suggest additional application to a broader range of pathogens and other geographically structured problems, such as antimicrobial resistance prediction, is warranted.},

The food supply chain consists of many organizations having different interests and are often reluctant to share traceability information with each other. Blockchain has been advocated for improving traceability by providing trust. Yet, practice proved to be more stubborn. The goal of this paper is to identify boundary conditions for sharing assurance information to improve traceability. Four cases in the food supply chain have been investigated using a template analysis of 16 interviews. Eighteen boundary conditions categorized in business, regulation, quality and traceability categories have been identified. Some boundary conditions were found in all supply chains, whereas others were found to be supply chain specific. Standardization of traceability processes and interfaces, having a joint platform and independent governance were found to be key boundary conditions before blockchain can be used. Our findings imply that supply chain systems have first to be modified and organizational measures need to be taken to fulfill the boundary conditions, before blockchain can be used successfully.},

In contrast, tests for the detection of clusters are concerned with screening a large region for evidence of individual 'hot spots' of disease but without any preconception about their likely locations; the results of such tests may form the basis for subsequent small area investigations, statistical or non-statistical, but will rarely be an end in themselves. The main intention of the paper is to describe and illustrate a new technique for the identification of small clusters of disease. A secondary purpose is to discuss some common pitfalls in the application of tests of clustering to epidemiological data.},

  abstract = {Foodborne diseases are an increasing concern to public health; climate and socioeconomic factors influence bacterial foodborne disease outbreaks. We developed an ``exposure--sensitivity--adaptability'' vulnerability assessment framework to explore the spatial characteristics of multiple climatic and socioeconomic environments, and analyzed the risk of foodborne disease outbreaks in different vulnerable environments of Zhejiang Province, China. Global logistic regression (GLR) and geographically weighted logistic regression (GWLR) models were combined to quantify the influence of selected variables on regional bacterial foodborne diseases and evaluate the potential risk. GLR results suggested that temperature, total precipitation, road density, construction area proportions, and gross domestic product (GDP) were positively correlated with foodborne diseases. GWLR results indicated that the strength and significance of these relationships varied locally, and the predicted risk map revealed that the risk of foodborne diseases caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus was higher in urban areas (60.6\%) than rural areas (20.1\%). Finally, distance from the coastline was negatively correlated with predicted regional risks. This study provides a spatial perspective for the relevant departments to prevent and control foodborne diseases.},

IoT has provided new opportunities in different domains but also challenges are apparent that must be addressed. Little attention has been paid to the potential use of IoT in the food safety domain and therefore the aim of this study was to fill this gap. Scope and approach This paper reviews the use of IoT technology in food safety. A literature review was conducted using academic documents written in English language and published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The relevant articles were analysed using the bibliometric networks to investigate the relationships between authors, countries, and content. Key findings and conclusions IoT in food safety is a relatively new approach; the first article appeared in 2011 and has increased since then. Majority of these studies were performed by Chinese universities and the main IoT applications reported were on food supply chains to trace food products, followed by monitoring of food safety and quality. The vast majority of publications were related to food, meat, cold chain products and agricultural products. These studies used sensors to monitor mainly temperature, humidity, and location. The most frequently used communication technologies were Internet, radio frequency identifications (RFID) and wireless sensor networks (WSN). This article identifies knowledge gaps to inform the community, industry, government authorities about research directions for IoT in food safety.},

Studies have found microbial subtyping to be a powerful tool for source attribution, but comparisons of different methodologies are limited. In this study, we compare three source attribution approaches (Machine Learning, Network Analysis, and Bayesian modeling) using three types of whole genome sequences (WGS) data inputs (cgMLST, 5-Mers and 7-Mers). We predicted and compared the sources of human campylobacteriosis cases in Denmark. Using 7mer as an input feature provided the best model performance. The network analysis algorithm had a CSC value of 78.99\% and an F1-score value of 67\%, while the machine-learning algorithm showed the highest accuracy (98\%). The models attributed between 965 and all of the 1224 human cases to a source (network applying 5mer and machine learning applying 7mer, respectively). Chicken from Denmark was the primary source of human campylobacteriosis with an average percentage probability of attribution of 45.8\% to 65.4\%, representing Bayesian with 7mer and machine learning with cgMLST, respectively. Our results indicate that the different source attribution methodologies based on WGS have great potential for the surveillance and source tracking of Campylobacter. The results of such models may support decision makers to prioritize and target interventions.},

A dataset of traffic accidents recorded in Valencia (Spain) during 2014 and 2015 is analyzed in order to estimate the effects that school locations produce on traffic risk within their surroundings. The four typologies of school in this city according to the academic levels they offer (All-level, Preschool, Primary, Secondary) are distinguished and taken into consideration for the analysis. Two time windows comprising the starting time in the morning and the evening time once day school has ended are analyzed independently. Several statistical methods are used, including observed vs expected ratios, macroscopic conditional autoregressive modelling, logistic regression in the context of a case--control study design and risk modelling in relation to several school locations. The distances to each type of school and a set of environmental, trafficrelated, demographic and socioeconomic covariates are employed for the analysis. The macroscopic modelling of accident counts and the modelling of risk as a function of the distance to each type of school serves to confirm that proximity to a school has an effect on the incidence of traffic accidents in particular time windows. Specifically, school types coexisting in Valencia show differential behaviour in this regard. In addition, several covariates have displayed a positive (bus stop density, complex intersections, main road length) and negative (land use entropy) association with accident counts in the time windows investigated. Finally, the definition of a case--control study design enabled us to observe some differences undetected by the macroscopic approaches that would require further research.},

  abstract = {Analyzing how the proximity to certain features or particular places in a city increases or decreases crime risk across space is a fundamental issue in quantitative criminology from both explanatory and predictive perspectives. Regarding the latter, the detection of high-risk cells is of special interest for practical reasons. There are several statistical modeling approaches that can be implemented in order to fulfil these two main objectives. The purpose of this study is to compare risk terrain modeling (RTM), a method widely used among quantitative criminologists, with a non-linear effects model that considers a non-linear function of distances to the selected places. To this end, a dataset containing crime events recorded in Valencia (Spain) along four years was used to perform the comparison. Several socio-demographic covariates and a selection of places in the city were considered for modeling crime counts with both the RTM and the non-linear approaches. The two modeling techniques were moderately coherent with regard to detecting certain types of places as responsible of higher (or lower) crime rates, but several differences arose. Furthermore, the non-linear model was more accurate than RTM to predict future crime occurrences for each of the three crime types that were considered for the analysis. In conclusion, the possibility of modeling the effect of a place on crime risk through non-linear functions appears as one competitive alternative or at least complement to RTM that may deserve further consideration.},

The technological revolution we have been witnessing during the last decade, the global rise of the Internet, the emergence of social media and social networks that connect individuals worldwide for information exchange and social interactions, and the almost complete social penetration of mobile devices such as smartphones provide access to data on individual behavior with unprecedented resolution and precision. In digital epidemiology, this type of high-resolution behavioral data is analyzed to advance our understanding of, for example, infectious disease dynamics and improve our abilities to forecast epidemic outbreaks and related phenomena.             This article provides an overview on the topic. Different aspects of digital epidemiology are alluded to. Based on examples, I~will explain how epidemiological data is integrated on new comprehensive and interactive websites, how the analysis of interactions and activities on social media platforms can yield answers to epidemiological questions, and finally how individual-based data collected by smartphones or wearable sensors in natural experiments can be used to reconstruct contact and physical proximity networks the knowledge of which substantially improves the predictive power of computational models for transmissible infectious diseases.             The challenges posed in terms of privacy protection and data security will be discussed. Concepts and solutions will be explained that may help to improve public health by leveraging the new data while at the same time protecting the individual's data sovereignty and personal dignity.},

To describe resistance in Salmonella that caused foodborne outbreaks in the United States, we linked outbreaks submitted to the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System to isolate susceptibility data in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System. Resistant outbreaks were defined as those linked to one or more isolates with resistance to at least one antimicrobial drug. Multidrug resistant (MDR) outbreaks had at least one isolate resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes. Twenty-one per cent (37/176) of linked outbreaks were resistant. In outbreaks attributed to a single food group, 73\% (16/22) of resistant outbreaks and 46\% (31/68) of non-resistant outbreaks were attributed to foods from land animals (P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}05). MDR Salmonella with clinically important resistance caused 29\% (14/48) of outbreaks from land animals and 8\% (3/40) of outbreaks from plant products (P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}01). In our study, resistant Salmonella infections were more common in outbreaks attributed to foods from land animals than outbreaks from foods from plants or aquatic animals. Antimicrobial susceptibility data on isolates from foodborne Salmonella outbreaks can help determine which foods are associated with resistant infections.},

  abstract = {Romaine lettuce has become a recurring source of foodborne illness outbreaks over the past decade. Most lettuce consumed in the United States originates from two primary sources: California and Arizona. Federal, state, and local authorities that investigate outbreaks linked to the consumption of romaine lettuce encounter many challenges during traceback and on-farm investigations that hinder their ability to determine the root cause of contamination. In this study, we investigate market signals (including price and shipment volumes) and weather parameters and their correlation with past outbreaks of Shiga Toxin-producing Escherichia coli illnesses linked to the consumption of romaine lettuce. We construct a daily panel of economic and weather data for eight outbreaks linked to romaine growing regions in California and Arizona from 2011 to 2019 and estimate the relative importance of these indicators on the probability of identifying each outbreak. Results suggest that prior increases in price and shipments are positively associated with outbreaks. In addition, some weather variables, most consistently daily maximum temperature, are positively associated with the probability of identifying an outbreak. Monitoring data for market and weather signals, coupled with a deeper understanding of regional supply shifts could help investigators quickly identify conditions that may signal an increased probability of outbreaks linked to romaine lettuce. Early detection can lead to improved education and outreach as well as targeted inspectional and sampling efforts. {\copyright} 2022},

  abstract = {Introduction: Shotgun metagenomics has previously proven effective in the investigation of foodborne outbreaks by providing rapid and comprehensive insights into the microbial contaminant. However, culture enrichment of the sample has remained a prerequisite, despite the potential impact on pathogen detection resulting from the growth competition. To circumvent the need for culture enrichment, we explored the use of adaptive sampling using various databases for a targeted nanopore sequencing, compared to shotgun metagenomics alone.  Methods: The adaptive sampling method was first tested on DNA of mashed potatoes mixed with DNA of a Staphylococcus aureus strain previously associated with a foodborne outbreak. The selective sequencing was used to either deplete the potato sequencing reads or enrich for the pathogen sequencing reads, and compared to a shotgun sequencing. Then, living S. aureus were spiked at 105 CFU into 25 g of mashed potatoes. Three DNA extraction kits were tested, in combination with enrichment using adaptive sampling, following whole genome amplification. After data analysis, the possibility to characterize the contaminant with the different sequencing and extraction methods, without culture enrichment, was assessed.  Results: Overall, the adaptive sampling outperformed the shotgun sequencing. While the use of a host removal DNA extraction kit and targeted sequencing using a database of foodborne pathogens allowed rapid detection of the pathogen, the most complete characterization was achieved when using solely a database of S. aureus combined with a conventional DNA extraction kit, enabling accurate placement of the strain on a phylogenetic tree alongside outbreak cases. Discussion: This method shows great potential for strain-level analysis of foodborne outbreaks without the need for culture enrichment, thereby enabling faster investigations and facilitating precise pathogen characterization. The integration of adaptive sampling with metagenomics presents a valuable strategy for more efficient and targeted analysis of microbial communities in foodborne outbreaks, contributing to improved food safety and public health.},

  abstract = {Investigating outbreaks of Shiga toxin--producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in England is a priority due to the potential severity of disease. However, there are often challenges in investigating outbreaks due to the small numbers of cases, poor patient recall, and low levels of bacteria that are challenging to detect in food samples using traditional laboratory culture techniques, and frequently a source is not identified. In September 2014, we investigated an STEC O157 outbreak associated with consuming a slaw garnish, and we report our findings here. Twenty confirmed cases were identified. Outbreak cases were interviewed, and menus reviewed to identify dishes consumed outside the home. Cases shared a history of eating meals at different chain restaurants. Analysis of menu items indicated shared consumption of slaw garnishes by 85.6\% cases, although just 35.7\% reported consuming them during interviews. Whole-genome sequencing linked cases where interpretation of the multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis profile was obscured and indicated that the strain originated from a domestic (i.e., United Kingdom) source. Traceback identified that carrots and cabbages grown in the United Kingdom were the likely source of infection. Samples of products were examined, but STEC was not recovered. Epidemiological investigations linked the outbreak to consumption of a slaw garnish, which was poorly recalled by cases, and likely comprised of domestically produced raw vegetables. The causative organism was not isolated from food samples, and we conclude that future investigations should include sampling of animals and wildlife in the vicinity of farms where implicated produce is grown.},

  abstract = {Given instances (spatial points) of different spatial features (categories), significant spatial co-distribution pat\- tern discovery aims to find subsets of spatial features whose spatial distributions are statistically significantly similar to each other. Discovering significant spatial co-distribution patterns is important for many application domains such as identifying spatial associations between diseases and risk factors in spatial epidemiology. Previous methods mostly associated spatial features whose instances are frequently located together; however, this does not necessarily indicate a similarity in the spatial distributions between different features. Thus, this paper defines the significant spatial co-distribution pattern discovery problem and subsequently develops a novel method to solve it effectively. First, we propose a new measure, dissimilarity index, to quantify the difference between spatial distributions of different features under the spatial neighbor relation and then employ it in a distribution clustering method to detect candidate spatial co-distribution patterns. To further remove spurious patterns that occur accidentally, the validity of each candidate spatial co-distribution pattern is verified through a significance test under the null hypothesis that spatial distributions of different features are independent of each other. To model the null hypothesis, a distribution shift-correction method is presented by randomizing the relationships between different features and maintaining spatial structure of each feature (e.g., spatial autocorrelation). Comparisons with baseline methods using synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. A case study identifying co-morbidities in central Colorado is also presented to illustrate the real-world applicability of the proposed method.},

Identifying animal reservoirs and potential transmission pathways of Salmonella is essential for prevention and control. There are many approaches for source attribution, each using different statistical models and data streams. Some aim to identify the animal reservoir, while others aim to determine the point at which exposure occurred. With the advance of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technologies, new source attribution models will greatly benefit from the discriminating power gained with WGS. This review discusses some key source attribution methods and their mathematical and statistical tools. We also highlight recent studies utilizing WGS for source attribution and discuss open questions and challenges in developing new WGS methods. We aim to provide a better understanding of the current state of these methodologies with application to Salmonella and other foodborne pathogens that are common sources of illness in the poultry and human sectors.},

  abstract = {Salmonellosis is estimated to cause more than 1.2 million illnesses each year in the United States, with more than 23,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths (1). Salmonella infections most often cause gastroenteritis, which can range from mild to severe. However, invasive infections can also occur and can be severe and life-threatening. National surveillance for Salmonella infections was established in the United States in 1962. Clinical diagnostic laboratories submit Salmonella isolates from human clinical specimens to state and territorial public health laboratories, where they are confirmed and serotyped according to the Kauffmann-White scheme. Reports of these laboratory-confirmed Salmonella isolates are then submitted by state and territorial public health departments to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2). Unusual or untypable serotypes are forwarded to the National Salmonella Reference Laboratory at CDC for further characterization or confirmation; results are reported back to state and territorial public health laboratories. Serotyping provides a consistent subtyping scheme for that has changed little over time, permitting analysis of trends in surveillance data. In the United States, serotype-specific Salmonella surveillance is conducted to define endemic patterns of salmonellosis, to detect outbreaks, to identify temporal trends in disease transmission, and to monitor the impact of control efforts. This report summarizes 42 years of surveillance data on Salmonella isolates from humans, and includes analyses by age, sex, geography, and season. In addition to reports of isolates from humans, reports of Salmonella isolates from animals and related sources (e.g., environment and feeds) are included in this report; these data come from the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) of the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS). These isolates are submitted by veterinary diagnostic laboratories throughout the United States for serotyping (2). Clinical animal isolates (referred to as ``clinical/non-human'') are Salmonella isolates from animals with clinical signs consistent with salmonellosis; ``non-clinical/non-human'' isolates are Salmonella isolates ide},

  abstract = {Background: Milk is a nutrient-rich food that makes an important contribution to diets in several Low and Middle Income Countries such as Senegal. Milk can also harbour several pathogenic microorganisms. As in other low and middle income countries, the dairy industry in Senegal is growing, with an expansion of farms to meet rapidly growing demand in the cities. However, most of the production still happens in the informal sector, and little is known about consumption of milk and milk products, or knowledge, awareness and practices of actors in informal dairy supply chains.  Methods: We conducted structured focus group discussions with dairy farmers and milk processors in three selected regions (Dakar, Thies and Fatick) in Senegal to investigate the consumption practices, awareness of milk borne hazards, and practices relevant to the risk of milk contamination to gain a deeper understanding of drivers of milk-borne diseases. Data on the consumption of milk and milk products were also collected using a closed questionnaire.  Results: Results indicate that milk is an important part of the diet in the study regionsand raw milk consumption is very common. The most common milk product consumed was fermented milk. Awareness of milk borne hazards was limited. Several farmers and processors reported risky practices, despite being aware of better practices, due to cultural beliefs. In households, children, pregnant women and older people were prioritised when milk and milk products were distributed. Dairy farmers and milk processors were more concerned with the lack of food for animals, low production and seasonality of production than the safety of the milk and milk products.  Conclusions: Lack of awareness of milk borne infections and some traditional practices put milk and milk product consumers in the study area at high risk of milk borne diseases. Prioritising certain sub population at households (Pregnant women and children) makes then vulnerable to milk-borne hazards. It will be challenging to change the risky practices as they are motivated by cultural beliefs hence the best strategy to promote milk safety will be to encourage the boiling of milk by consumers.},

We used historical import data to examine the correlation between the port of entry for five implicated produce vehicles from five multistate outbreaks and the geospatial and temporal distribution of illnesses in the corresponding outbreaks in the United States. For comparison, we analyzed the geospatial and temporal distribution of cases from two U.S. multistate outbreaks associated with domestically grown produce. The geospatial distribution of illnesses in the two outbreaks linked to domestic produce differed from that of the import-related produce outbreaks. The results of our pilot study suggest that geospatial distribution of early-onset cases may be used to identify ports of entry for produce likely to be responsible for causing multistate outbreaks in the United States and that targeted sampling of produce items from these ports of entry may expedite identification of an outbreak vehicle.},

  abstract = {Zoonoses are diseases transmitted from animals to humans, posing a great threat to the health and life of people all over the world. According to WHO estimations, 600 million cases of diseases caused by contaminated food were noted in 2010, including almost 350 million caused by pathogenic bacteria. Campylobacter, Salmonella, as well as Yersinia enterocolitica and Listeria monocytogenes may dwell in livestock (poultry, cattle, and swine) but are also found in wild animals, pets, fish, and rodents. Animals, often being asymptomatic carriers of pathogens, excrete them with faeces, thus delivering them to the environment. Therefore, pathogens may invade new individuals, as well as reside on vegetables and fruits. Pathogenic bacteria also penetrate food production areas and may remain there in the form of a biofilm covering the surfaces of machines and equipment. A common occurrence of microbes in food products, as well as their improper or careless processing, leads to common poisonings. Symptoms of foodborne infections may be mild, sometimes flu-like, but they also may be accompanied by severe complications, some even fatal. The aim of the paper is to summarize and provide information on campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, yersiniosis, and listeriosis and the aetiological factors of those diseases, along with the general characteristics of pathogens, virulence factors, and reservoirs.},

  abstract = {This paper presents discussions on data needs for assessment of food product risk and attribution of foodborne illnesses to food products. Working with the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) adapted a Bayesian statistical model to quantify attribution of meat, poultry, and eggs as sources of human salmonellosis in the United States. The model was fitted to the observed number of domestic and sporadic salmonellosis cases using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the joint posterior distribution.  Our study shows that to adequately assess food product risk and attribute illnesses to food products, we need to obtain data concerning pathogen prevalence and distribution in a wide variety of potential food vehicles and for other important sources of human exposure, such as indirect sources of contamination and non-food sources. Another challenge we encountered is the need to ensure that existing data sources continue to adequately represent the burden of foodborne illnesses in the U.S. population and the distribution of the associated pathogen in food vehicles and exposure sources of interest. Additionally, we need to refine existing data so that the comparisons between data from various sources are based on similar units of observation at the necessary levels of discrimination for defined points along the farm-to-table continuum.  Assessment of food product safety and attribution of foodborne illnesses require extensive data originating from various sources. However, currently available data sources suffer from methodological limitations and the unavailability of certain types of data often result in critical data gaps. An expert elicitation conducted by FSIS shows that when epidemiologic data are lacking, are sparse, or are highly uncertain, data from expert elicitation are useful to fill the critical gaps in food safety studies.},

  abstract = {Supply chain visibility is a challenging problem for many commercial companies. The growing market of real-time transportation visibility platforms attempts to address the issue. Transport mode detection is critical to the core services of RTTVPs, such as ETA prediction and modal split analysis for the subsequent sustainable development of their clients. On the topic of modality detection, many studies have been published focusing on GPS or cellular phone data, while sparse event-based records remain unexplored. I propose and implement a framework concentrating on such datasets to bridge this research gap. My model follows quantitative methodology and employs spatial and temporal analyses based on curve-to-curve matching and dynamic time warping algorithms to infer the transport mode. I apply the framework to the actual dataset containing timestamped locations regarding container movements for six months. The model performs well in spatial analysis, generating predictions with an average deviation of 7.9 kilometers from the trajectories. Due to temporal analysis, the algorithm matches 35\% of the trajectories to the respective schedules. This work contributes to the literature by proposing a novel approach to detect transport modes from event-based data, independently conducting spatial and temporal analyses. The contribution to the practical field derives from the implementation of the algorithm and its ability to be employed by other RTTVPs.},

Fish is also very susceptible to spoilage and contamination by microorganisms throughout the food chain, which may be part of the usual microbiota or incorporated into food derived from inadequate hygiene practices in the food industry. Fish has been associated worldwide with disease outbreaks derived from consumption, where various bacteria and/or metabolites (biogenic amines) are some of the main casual agents. Citrobacter sp. is considered a pathogen in fish, as well as in humans, derived from the consumption of contaminated food, generating infections or histamine poisoning as it is part of the generating microbiota. Therefore, the objective of this document is to provide information on Citrobacter sp. through a general perspective on animal health and the safety of fish and fish products. Diseases derived from Citrobacter sp. contamination are included, as well as control, prevention, and sanitary legislation actions to promote animal health and the safety of foods of aquatic origin and the protection of public health.},

Many of the ways to manipulate spatial data are driven by algorithms with no uncertainty quantification associated with them. When a spatial analysis is statistical, that is, it incorporates uncertainty quantification, it falls in the research area called spatial statistics. The primary feature of spatial statistical models is that nearby attribute values are more statistically dependent than distant attribute values; this is a paraphrasing of what is sometimes called the First Law of Geography (Tobler, 1970).},

  abstract = {In the absence of epidemiological, microbiological or outbreak data, systematic identification of the hazards and food products posing the higher risk to the consumers is challenging. It is usually in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), where the burden of foodborne disease is highest that data tend to be particularly scarce. In this study, we propose qualitative risk-ranking methods for pathogens and food products that can be used in settings where scarcity of data on the frequency/concentration of pathogens in foodstuff is a barrier towards the use of classical risk assessment frameworks. The approach integrates the existing knowledge on foodborne pathogens, manufacturing processes and intrinsic/extrinsic properties of food products with key context-specific information regarding the supply chain(s), characteristics of the Food Business Operators (FBOs) and cultural habits to identify: (i) the pathogens that should be considered as a ``High'' food safety priority and (ii) the food products posing the higher risk of consumer exposure to microbiological hazards via the oral (ingestion) route. When applied to the dairy sector of Andhra Pradesh (India) as a case study, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, Salmonella spp., S. aureus and L. monocytogenes were identified as a ``High'' food safety priority across all FBOs. C. sakazakii was identified as a ``High'' priority for the FBOs producing infant formula/milk powder whilst Shigella spp., and Cryptosporidium spp. a ``High'' priority when considering the FBOs operating in the unregulated sector. Given the diversity of dairy products considered in the assessment, cluster analysis was used to identify products that shared similar intrinsic/extrinsic features known to drive the microbiological risk. The risk ranking was then done integrating the results of the cluster analysis with context-specific information. Products manufactured/retailed by FBOs in the informal market were considered as posing a ``High'' risk for the consumers due to a widespread lack of compliance to sanitary regulations. For dairy products produced by FBOs operating in the middle and formal end of the formal-informal spectrum, the risk of consumers exposure to microbiological hazards ranged from ``Moderate'' to ``Extremely low'' depending on the FBO and the intrinsic/extrinsic properties of the products. While providing risk estimates of lower precision if compared to data-driven risk assessments, the proposed method maximises the value of the information that can be easily gathered in LMICs and provide informative outputs to support food safety decision-making in contexts where resources to be allocated for prevention of foodborne diseases are limited and the food system is complex.},

Modeling logistics at the regional level establishes a link between trade flow and transport flow, allows the warehouse and distribution center locations and throughput volumes to be determined, and permits more detailed and accurate policy decision support systems. This paper describes a two-stage logistics model that estimates the volume of regional warehouse throughput. The first stage estimates interregional trade flows by means of a gravity model application and starts from regional production and consumption volumes. The second stage, the logistics chain model, splits the production--consumption flow between direct shipments and shipments that go through warehouse facilities. An aggregate multinomial logit discrete choice model is used to determine the flow volumes for each of the possible logistics chains. Consistency is achieved between the gravity and logistics chain models by a joint estimation of unknown parameters. A new data set from a transport flow survey produced by Statistics Netherlands is used; the data set includes information on the types of loading and unloading location. This data set enables model calibration with respect to regional warehouse throughput. The proposed logistics chain model produces accurate estimates of regional warehouse throughput and plausible parameter values. The paper presents the specification of the new model, the data set used, and the results of the estimation.},

  abstract = {In the last decades a large number of models have been developed in the quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) and predictive microbiology (PM) domains. These models were generated with different scripting languages (e.g. R, MATLAB), commercial tools (e.g. @Risk) or even proprietary software tools (e.g. FSSP, FDA-iRISK). The heterogeneity in software tools used to generate models together with the lack of a harmonized model exchange format has made the (re)-use of existing models in different software tools or simulation environments very difficult. The adoption of a harmonized information exchange format called Food Safety Knowledge Markup Language (FSK-ML) would be a solution to this challenge. FSK-ML defines a framework for encoding all relevant data, metadata and model scripts in a machine-readable format. A specific feature of FSK-ML is that it allows the user to provide model scripts in different scripting languages (e.g. R, Perl, Python or MATLAB). Model metadata can be provided in accordance with the metadata schema and controlled vocabularies proposed from the Risk Assessment Knowledge Integration Platform (RAKIP) community. In order to achieve a broad adoption of FSK-ML by the scientific community it is however of extraordinary importance to provide support in terms of easy to use software solutions. In fact, it has to be as simple as possible for the end-user to create, export, import or modify standard-compliant files. Food Safety Knowledge Lab (FSK-Lab) represents such a user-friendly software tool that can create, read (import), write (export), execute and combine FSK-ML compliant objects. All metadata needed to annotate a model can also be entered and edited through FSK-Lab. It also allows generating (export) files that comply with FSK-ML and that carry the file extension ``.fskx''. This ensures that all information on a model is contained in this information exchange file and that the user does not have to write and compile FSK-ML files ``by hand''. FSK-Lab extends the open source Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) data analytics platform (URL: www.knime.org), which is a graphical programming framework allowing users to create data analysis workflows from building blocks (so called nodes). Within FSK-Lab, each node has a specific task e.g. model creation can be performed with the ``FSK Creator'' node. As a KNIME extension, FSK-Lab allows the user to execute and integrate code from several programming languages, like Java, R, Python. All FSK-Lab software code is freely available under the GNU public license version 3.},

Machine learning holds potential in leveraging large, emerging data sets to improve the safety of the food supply and mitigate the impact of food safety incidents. Foodborne pathogen genomes and novel data streams, including text, transactional, and trade data, have seen emerging applications enabled by a machine learning approach, such as prediction of antibiotic resistance, source attribution of pathogens, and foodborne outbreak detection and risk assessment. In this article, we provide a gentle introduction to machine learning in the context of food safety and an overview of recent developments and applications. With many of these applications still in their nascence, general and domain-specific pitfalls and challenges associated with machine learning have begun to be recognized and addressed, which are critical to prospective use and future deployment of large data sets and their associated machine learning models for food safety applications.},

This topic has its origins in concerns about the health effects to the surrounding population of potentially toxic emissions from industrial sites. We describe approaches to the problem that apply the theory of spatial point processes to the analysis of data from an epidemiological case--control study. We first formulate an idealized model in which cases and controls are modeled as inhomogeneous Poisson point processes whose spatially varying intensities are linked by a relative risk function D(x), where x denotes location. Typically, D({$\cdot$}) is modeled as a function of the distance, and possibly the orientation, of x relative to the point source of interest. We show how likelihood-based inference about D({$\cdot$}) can be carried out by fitting a nonlinear binary regression model to the case--control labels, conditioning on the locations of cases and controls. We describe several specific parametric models that have been suggested in the literature, and a nonparametric alternative in which D({$\cdot$}) is modeled as a smooth, but otherwise arbitrary, function of distance.},

Our aim in the current work was to further evaluate the case-chaos method. Using a theoretical example of 2 risk factors, we demonstrated that the case-chaos design yields risk estimations for which the odds ratios obtained for every risk factor are in the same ascending order as the risk factors' exposure prevalences in the case group. Applying the method to data from the European Study of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (EuroSCAR; 1997--2001), we were not able to obtain sensible results but instead produced results as predicted by our theoretical assessment. We therefore claim that the method is equivalent to declaring risk solely on the basis of prevalences obtained in cases. While the proposers of the case-chaos method view it as a useful adjunct, we show that it cannot produce sensible estimates.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades the globalization of trade has significantly altered the topology of food supply chains. Even though foodborne illness has been consistently on the decline, the hazardous impact of contamination events is larger [1-3]. Possible contaminants include pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins or chemicals. Contamination can occur accidentally, e.g. due to improper handling, preparation, or storage, or intentionally as the melamine milk crisis proved. To identify the source of a food-borne disease it is often necessary to reconstruct the food distribution networks spanning different distribution channels or product groups. The time needed to trace back the contamination source ranges from days to weeks and significantly influences the economic and public health impact of a disease outbreak. In this paper we describe a modelbased approach designed to speed up the identification of a food-borne disease outbreak source. Further, we exploit the geospatial information of wholesaler-retailer food distribution networks limited to a given food type and apply a gravity model for food distribution from retailer to consumer. We present a likelihood framework that allows determining the likelihood of wholesale source(s) distributing contaminated food based on geo-coded case reports. The developed method is independent of the underlying food distribution kernel and thus particularly applicable to empirical distributions of food acquisition.},

  abstract = {Improving traceability in food supply chains has been a big part of ongoing effort to reduce contamination risks and food waste. Recent technology advancement such as blockchain technology has propelled innovative retailers to promote food traceability system adoption in their supply chains. We develop a three-tier supply chain model with multiple upstream (tier-2) suppliers to investigate: how traceability technology adoption affects incentives of supply chain members, and whether and how its anticipated benefits can be realized. We find that full traceability brings direct revenue benefit to every supply chain member by saving uncontaminated food from disposal (pure traceability effect), but also leaves each tier of the supply chain vulnerable to its immediate downstream buyer's exploitation through strategically lowering the purchasing price (strategic pricing effect). The interplay of the two effects may result in some of the supply chain members (even the retailer) being worse off with traceability adoption, and the system being exposed to higher contamination risk; the latter is due to the weakened upstream supplier's incentive to exert contamination risk-reduction effort. Moreover, we find that the supply chain network structure also influences the benefit distribution of traceability adoption: The retailer always benefits from traceability adoption in network structures where the tier-1 supplier's strategic pricing power is eliminated or weakened; all supply chain members benefit from traceability adoption in a network with a large number of tier-2 suppliers. Finally, we show that alternative risk-mitigation schemes such as tier-2 coordination can diminish the value of traceability adoption, and partial traceability enabled by tier-1 product inspection can be more beneficial to the retailer than full traceability.},

Outbreak investigations are often challenging and time-consuming, and most outbreak vehicles remain unidentified. The development of alternative investigative strategies is therefore needed. Automated analysis of Consumer Purchase Data (CPD) gathered by retailers represents one such alternative strategy. CPD-aided investigations do not require trawling questionnaires to create a hypothesis and can provide analytical measures of association by direct data analysis. Here, we used anonymized CPD from 920,384 customers enrolled in Norway's largest supermarket loyalty program to simulate foodborne outbreaks across a range of different parameters and scenarios. We then applied a logistic regression model to calculate an odds ratio for each of the different possible food vehicles. By this method, we were able to identify outbreak vehicles with a 90\% accuracy within a median of 6 recorded case-patients. The outbreak vehicle identification rate declined significantly when using data from only one of two retailers involved in a simulated outbreak. Performance was also reduced in simulations that restricted analysis from product ID to the product group levels accessible by trawling questionnaires. Our results show that---assuming agreements are in place with major retailers---CPD collection and analysis can solve foodborne outbreaks originating from supermarkets both more rapidly and accurately than than questionnaire-based methods and might provide a significant enhancement to current outbreak investigation methods.},

The analysis may be based on case-control data or on aggregated data. The definition of the function relating risk of disease and distance is critical, both in a classical and in a Bayesian framework, because the likelihood is usually very flat, even with large amounts of data. In this paper we investigate how the specification of the function relating risk of disease with distance from the source and of the prior distributions on the parameters of the function affects the results when case-control data and Bayesian methods are used. We consider different popular parametric models for the risk distance function in a Bayesian approach, comparing estimates with those derived by maximum likelihood. As an example we have analyzed the relationship between a putative source of environmental pollution (an asbestos cement plant) and the occurrence of pleural malignant mesothelioma in the area of Casale Monferrato (Italy) in 1987-1993. Risk of pleural malignant mesothelioma turns out to be strongly related to distance from the asbestos cement plant. However, as the models appeared to be sensitive to modeling choices, we suggest that any analysis of disease risk around a putative source should be integrated with a careful sensitivity analysis and possibly with prior knowledge. The choice of prior distribution is extremely important and should be based on epidemiological considerations.},

OBJECTIVE We aimed to design a spatial-temporal risk prediction model suitable for predicting foodborne disease risks in various regions, to provide guidance for the prevention and control of foodborne diseases. METHODS We designed a novel end-to-end framework to predict foodborne disease risk by using a multigraph structural long short-term memory neural network, which can utilize an encoder-decoder to achieve multistep prediction. In particular, to capture multiple spatial correlations, we divided regions by administrative area and constructed adjacent graphs with metrics that included region proximity, historical data similarity, regional function similarity, and exposure food similarity. We also integrated an attention mechanism in both spatial and temporal dimensions, as well as external factors, to refine prediction accuracy. We validated our model with a long-term real-world foodborne disease data set, comprising data from 2015 to 2019 from multiple provinces in China. RESULTS Our model can achieve F1 scores of 0.822, 0.679, 0.709, and 0.720 for single-month forecasts for the provinces of Beijing, Zhejiang, Shanxi and Hebei, respectively, and the highest F1 score was 20\% higher than the best results of the other models. The experimental results clearly demonstrated that our approach can outperform other state-of-the-art models, with a margin. CONCLUSIONS The spatial-temporal risk prediction model can take into account the spatial-temporal characteristics of foodborne disease data and accurately determine future disease spatial-temporal risks, thereby providing support for the prevention and risk assessment of foodborne disease.},

  abstract = {Abstract The source of a foodborne disease outbreak (FBO) is often difficult to identify, especially in the early phase where interventions would be most efficient. In addition, data on FBOs are mostly scattered in different formats either in national databases and reports or within pathogen-specific or regional reporting networks, both of which are often only accessible to a selected number of individuals. Here, we developed an international, open, shared and searchable data catalogue of past FBOs -- the Global Food-source Identifier (GFI). GFI was developed with two objectives: a) to create a collaborative online community of FBO investigators, encouraging the international sharing of data in a harmonized, detailed and comparable manner and b) to support foodborne outbreak investigation worldwide by providing access to detailed records of past outbreaks, which can convey valuable insight into potential `risk foods' of a detected pathogen. GFI is hosted within a Virtual Research Environment (VRE), which offers additional features to facilitate the collaboration between the outbreak investigators. These features allow document exchange, communication and data visualization and analysis between the VRE members. Based on scientific literature on foodborne outbreaks and discussions within a working group, we selected a total of 46 attributes characterising the outbreak records to be included in the catalogue, aggregated under the four overarching categories causative agent, epidata, food source and report details. Detailed descriptions of the attributes in the catalogue and instructions for harmonized data reporting are available on a wiki page in the VRE. At the time of writing and public launch of GFI, the data catalogue was populated with records of 102 FBOs occurred in Denmark over a period of 12 years (2005--2016) and covering the most frequent pathogens and a broad range of typing methods. The VRE features that enable data analysis, document sharing and communication between members were applied for the graphical representation of the records available in GFI, and for the sharing of results and script files within the VRE. The descriptive analysis included the relationship between the most frequent causative agents and outbreak food sources. Such results can support a risk-based food sampling strategy in the very beginning of a foodborne outbreak investigation. The Global Food-source Identifier is a data catalogue specifically designed to host an international collection of FBO records reported in a detailed and harmonized manner. It is implemented in a virtual research environment that offers key features to facilitate and enhance the global collaboration and data sharing among FBO investigators. Once in active use by the international food safety community, we envisage that GFI will contribute to the success of FBO investigations worldwide.},

However, since the meta-analysis by Szymanski, Bharadwaj, and Varadarajan (1993), substantial environmental (e.g., digitization) and methodological (e.g., accounting for endogeneity) developments have occurred. The current work presents an updated and extended meta-analysis based on all available 863 elasticities drawn from 89 studies and provides the following new empirical generalizations: (1) The average raw market share-financial performance elasticity is .132, which is substantially lower than the effectiveness of other intermediate marketing metrics. This result challenges a widely used strategy that solely focuses on increasing market share. (2) Elasticities differ significantly between contextual settings. For example, they are lower for business-to-business firms than for business-to-consumer firms, for service firms than for manufacturing firms, and for U.S. markets than for emerging and Western European markets. The authors also observe differences between countries with respect to a general time trend (e.g., lower elasticities in recent times for Western European markets) and recessionary periods (e.g., lower elasticities in the United States, higher elasticities in non-Western economies).},

We evaluated the method using data on outbreaks in Sweden. We identified 5 case-control studies from foodborne illness outbreaks that occurred between 2005 and 2012. Using case-chaos methodology, we calculated odds ratios 1,000 times for each exposure. We used the median as the point estimate and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles as the confidence interval. We compared case-chaos matched odds ratios with their respective case-control odds ratios in terms of statistical significance. Using Spearman's correlation, we estimated the correlation between matched odds ratios and the proportion of cases exposed to each exposure and quantified the relationship between the 2 using a normal linear mixed model. Each case-control study identified an outbreak vehicle (odds ratios = 4.9--45). Case-chaos methodology identified the outbreak vehicle 3 out of 5 times. It identified significant associations in 22 of 113 exposures that were not associated with outcome and 5 of 18 exposures that were significantly associated with outcome. Log matched odds ratios correlated with their respective proportion of cases exposed (Spearman {$\rho$} = 0.91) and increased significantly with the proportion of cases exposed (b = 0.054). Case-chaos methodology missed the outbreak source 2 of 5 times and identified spurious associations between a number of exposures and outcome. Measures of association correlated with the proportion of cases exposed. We recommended against using case-chaos analysis during outbreak investigations.},

  abstract = {Objective We developed a system for the discovery of foodborne illness mentioned in online Yelp restaurant reviews using text classification. The system is used by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to monitor Yelp for foodborne illness complaints. Materials and Methods We built classifiers for 2 tasks: (1) determining if a review indicated a person experiencing foodborne illness and (2) determining if a review indicated multiple people experiencing foodborne illness. We first developed a prototype classifier in 2012 for both tasks using a small labeled dataset. Over years of system deployment, DOHMH epidemiologists labeled 13\,526 reviews selected by this classifier. We used these biased data and a sample of complementary reviews in a principled bias-adjusted training scheme to develop significantly improved classifiers. Finally, we performed an error analysis of the best resulting classifiers. Results We found that logistic regression trained with bias-adjusted augmented data performed best for both classification tasks, with F1-scores of 87\% and 66\% for tasks 1 and 2, respectively. Discussion Our error analysis revealed that the inability of our models to account for long phrases caused the most errors. Our bias-adjusted training scheme illustrates how to improve a classification system iteratively by exploiting available biased labeled data. Conclusions Our system has been instrumental in the identification of 10 outbreaks and 8523 complaints of foodborne illness associated with New York City restaurants since July 2012. Our evaluation has identified strong classifiers for both tasks, whose deployment will allow DOHMH epidemiologists to more effectively monitor Yelp for foodborne illness investigations.},

Key statistics on zoonoses and zoonotic agents in humans, food, animals and feed are provided and interpreted historically. In 2021, the first and second most reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. Cases of campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis increased in comparison with 2020, but decreased compared with previous years. In 2021, data collection and analysis at the EU level were still impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the control measures adopted in the MSs, including partial or total lockdowns. Sixteen MSs and the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) achieved all the established targets in poultry populations for reduction in Salmonella prevalence for the relevant serovars. Salmonella samples from carcases of various animal species and samples for Campylobacter quantification from broiler carcases were more frequently positive when performed by the competent authorities than when own-checks were conducted. Yersiniosis was the third most reported zoonosis in humans, followed by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Listeria monocytogenes infections. L. monocytogenes and West Nile virus infections were the most severe zoonotic diseases, with the most hospitalisations and highest case fatality rates. Overall, MSs reported more foodborne outbreaks and cases in 2021 than in 2020. S. Enteritidis remained the most frequently reported causative agent for foodborne outbreaks. Salmonella in `eggs and egg products' and in `mixed foods' were the agent/food pairs of most concern. Outbreaks linked to `vegetables and juices and products thereof' rose considerably compared with previous years. This report also provides updates on brucellosis, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), echinococcosis, rabies, toxoplasmosis, trichinellosis, tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis or M. caprae, and tularaemia.},

It was concluded that there is no universal methodology for risk ranking. A conceptual risk ranking framework with nine separate stages is proposed to allow the adoption of the appropriate risk ranking methodology at each stage. Further, nine risk ranking tools developed by other institutions worldwide were described, although none of these could be recommended as the single risk ranking tool for the BIOHAZ Panel. It is recommended that the risk ranking exercise should take a structured approach and be transparently and consistently documented so to be reproducible. The importance of the proper correspondence between the time frame and the requirements of the risk ranking exercise was stressed as well as the interaction between the risk managers and the risk assessors in the definition of the risk ranking purpose and the presentation of the results. Furthermore the development of a risk ranking toolbox based on the proposed framework should be investigated, since such a toolbox would support the construction of consistent and transparent risk ranking models.},

  abstract = {This Opinion considers the application of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and metagenomics for outbreak investigation, source attribution and risk assessment of food-borne pathogens. WGS offers the highest level of bacterial strain discrimination for food-borne outbreak investigation and source-attribution as well as potential for more precise hazard identification, thereby facilitating more targeted risk assessment and risk management. WGS improves linking of sporadic cases associated with different food products and geographical regions to a point source outbreak and can facilitate epidemiological investigations, allowing also the use of previously sequenced genomes. Source attribution may be favoured by improved identification of transmission pathways, through the integration of spatial-temporal factors and the detection of multidirectional transmission and pathogen--host interactions. Metagenomics has potential, especially in relation to the detection and characterisation of non-culturable, difficult-to-culture or slow-growing microorganisms, for tracking of hazard-related genetic determinants and the dynamic evaluation of the composition and functionality of complex microbial communities. A SWOT analysis is provided on the use of WGS and metagenomics for Salmonella and Shigatoxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) serotyping and the identification of antimicrobial resistance determinants in bacteria. Close agreement between phenotypic and WGS-based genotyping data has been observed. WGS provides additional information on the nature and localisation of antimicrobial resistance determinants and on their dissemination potential by horizontal gene transfer, as well as on genes relating to virulence and biological fitness. Interoperable data will play a major role in the future use of WGS and metagenomic data. Capacity building based on harmonised, quality controlled operational systems within European laboratories and worldwide is essential for the investigation of cross-border outbreaks and for the development of international standardised risk assessments of food-borne microorganisms.},

These include problems of data availability and quality, especially the lack in most situations of environmental exposure measurements. Methods for disease 'cluster' investigation, point source exposures, small-area disease mapping and ecological correlation studies are critically reviewed, with the emphasis on practical applications and epidemiological interpretation. It is shown that, unless dealing with rare diseases, high specificity exposures and high relative risks, cluster investigation is unlikely to be fruitful, and is often complicated by the post hoc nature of such studies. However, it is recognized that in these circumstances proper assessment of the available data is often required as part of the public health response. Newly availabe methods, particularly in Bayesian statistics, offer an appropriate framework for geographical analysis and disease mapping. Again, it is uncertain whether they will give important clues as to aetiology, although they do give valuable description. Perhaps the most satisfactory approach is to test a priori hypotheses using a geographical database, although problems of interpretation remain.},

Seven countries form the core of the IFTN, with high values of betweenness centrality and each trading with over 77\% of all the countries in the world. Graph theoretical analysis and a dynamic food flux model show that the IFTN provides a vehicle suitable for the fast distribution of potential contaminants but unsuitable for tracing their origin.

The 2017 monitoring specifically focussed on pigs and calves under 1 year of age, as well as their derived carcases/meat, while the monitoring performed in 2018 specifically focussed on poultry and their derived carcases/meat. Monitoring and reporting of AMR in 2017/2018 included data regarding Salmonella, Campylobacter and indicator Escherichia coli isolates, as well as data obtained from the specific monitoring of ESBL-/AmpC-/carbapenemase-producing E. coli isolates. Additionally, some MSs reported voluntary data on the occurrence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in animals and food, with some countries also providing data on antimicrobial susceptibility. This report provides, for the first time, an overview of the main findings of the 2017/2018 harmonised AMR monitoring in the main food-producing animal populations monitored, in related carcase/meat samples and in humans. Where available, data monitoring obtained from pigs, calves/cattle, broilers, laying hens and turkeys, as well as from carcase/meat samples and humans were combined and compared at the EU level, with particular emphasis on multiple drug resistance, complete susceptibility and combined resistance patterns to critically important antimicrobials, as well as Salmonella and E. coli isolates exhibiting presumptive ESBL-/AmpC-/carbapenemase-producing phenotypes. The outcome indicators for AMR in food-producing animals, such as complete susceptibility to the harmonised panel of antimicrobials in E. coli and the prevalence of ESBL-/AmpC-producing E. coli have been also specifically analysed over the period 2014--2018.},

  abstract = {This report by the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of the zoonoses monitoring and surveillance activities carried out in 2022 in 27 Member States (MSs), the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and 11 non-MSs. Key statistics on zoonoses and zoonotic agents in humans, food, animals and feed are provided and interpreted historically. In 2022, the first and second most reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The number of cases of campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis remained stable in comparison with 2021. Nineteen MSs and the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) achieved all the established targets in poultry populations for the reduction of Salmonella prevalence for the relevant serovars. Salmonella samples from carcases of various animal species, and samples for Campylobacter quantification from broiler carcases, were more frequently positive when performed by the competent authorities than when own checks were conducted. Yersiniosis was the third most reported zoonosis in humans, followed by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Listeria monocytogenes infections. L. monocytogenes and West Nile virus infections were the most severe zoonotic diseases, with the most hospitalisations and highest case fatality rates. In 2022, reporting showed an increase of more than 600\% compared with 2021 in locally acquired cases of human West Nile virus infection, which is a mosquito-borne disease. In the EU, the number of reported foodborne outbreaks and cases, hospitalisations and deaths was higher in 2022 than in 2021. The number of deaths from outbreaks was the highest ever reported in the EU in the last 10\,years, mainly caused by L. monocytogenes and to a lesser degree by Salmonella. Salmonella and in particular S. Enteritidis remained the most frequently reported causative agent for foodborne outbreaks. Norovirus (and other calicivirus) was the agent associated with the highest number of outbreak human cases. This report also provides updates on brucellosis, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), echinococcosis, rabies, toxoplasmosis, trichinellosis, infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (focusing on Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium caprae) and tularaemia.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a structured and transparent framework to rank emerging dietary practices. The first challenge was to rank simultaneously biological and chemical hazards using the same criteria whatever the nature of the hazard. For a list of dietary practices selected based on the results of a survey, hazard identification and health effect characterization was carried out. Taking only the top five practices led to the identification of 41 triplets ``emerging dietary practice -- hazard -- health effect'', which highlights the complexity of scoring risk in food safety. A wide variety of hazards, including microbes, parasites, mycotoxins, allergens and other chemical compounds were considered together with a range of health effects such as foodborne pathogen disease, anaphylaxis, cancer, immunosuppression, endocrine disturbance, etc. The second challenge was to develop a framework easy to populate and run. The risk-ranking framework included eight criteria: five to describe the severity, three to describe the likelihood. All of them were informed by literature data and food safety agencies' reports, plus experts' opinion. The PROMETHEE outranking MCDA technique, available in a R package, was implemented. This risk-ranking framework applied to the results of our small-scale survey revealed that consuming nuts on a regular basis could be the emerging dietary habit presenting the highest-risk score, due to the aflatoxin B1 hazard and its associated health effect (liver cancer). This risk-ranking framework requires however to be applied furthermore in other contexts to evaluate its robustness and identify opportunities for improvement. Once consolidated, this framework will be highly relevant for food safety authorities and policy makers to move forward transparent and evidence-informed decisions.},

We analyze the short-run impact of this return to protectionism on the U.S. economy. Import and retaliatory tariffs caused large declines in imports and exports. Prices of imports targeted by tariffs did not fall, implying complete pass-through of tariffs to duty-inclusive prices. The resulting losses to U.S. consumers and firms that buy imports was \$51 billion, or 0.27\% of GDP. We embed the estimated trade elasticities in a general-equilibrium model of the U.S. economy. After accounting for tariff revenue and gains to domestic producers, the aggregate real income loss was \$7.2 billion, or 0.04\% of GDP. Import tariffs favored sectors concentrated in politically competitive counties, and the model implies that tradeable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties were the most negatively affected due to the retaliatory tariffs.

Independent case-control studies linked infections in each outbreak with eating alfalfa sprouts that were traced to the same seed distributor. The Colorado sprouter reportedly complied with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sprout guidance, whereas the Minnesota sprouter did not. These investigations revealed that increased compliance with existing FDA guidance is needed and that additional research is needed to improve the alfalfa seed decontamination process. This reaffirms the FDA recommendation that raw alfalfa sprouts should be considered potentially contaminated and avoided by persons at high-risk such as the elderly, young children, and immunocompromised persons. PFGE played an essential role in linking these two temporally and geographically distinct E. coli O157 outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Agro-food networks are characterized by complex material exchanges among farms, processors, consumers, and waste managers involved in fertilization, food, feed and bioenergy production. Better coordination of material exchanges at the local scale can facilitate more efficient resource use. Here, we present a new agent-based model, ``Flows in Agro-food Networks'' (FAN), which simulates the processing and exchange of fertilizers, feed, food and wastes among farms and multiple upstream or downstream partners (feed and fertilizer suppliers, food industries, waste processors, and anaerobic digesters) in small farming regions. FAN includes a series of environmental indicators that can be used to assess alternative scenarios in terms of ecosystem services, nutrient cycling, and resource autonomy. We use a French case study to demonstrate FAN's dynamics and to explore the sensitivity of key parameters. We show a strong influence of spatial distance between agents, their disposition to exchange, and their preference for specific materials on local agro-food network simulations. FAN is powerful theoretical tool to explore and assess opportunities for a circular economy in small farming regions and to unravel interactions between recycling, environmental performance and food production.},

  abstract = {False alarms are -- in terms of fire safety engineering -- fire alarms in absence of a real fire condition. They are related to the exchange of information and occur as a side effect of system technologies and the alerting process. Fires often are associated with considerable damages. Because time is a critical factor, detection is often accomplished by installed Fire Detection and Fire Alarm Systems (FDAS). The highly sensitive sensors in fire detectors make the identification of fires in an early stage possible, but this also makes FDAS susceptible to false alarms. So far there is no reliable evidence on the ratio of false alarms to installed FDAS. The studies, which are described in the present paper, close this gap for Germany on the basis of an empirical analysis of data from fire brigades. This meta-analysis show that today the false alarm ratio triggered by installed FDAS (and connected to a fire brigade) is high in Germany. It is difficult to describe the ratio in one single value, because a great number of conditions and influencing factors are relevant. To reduce the false alarm ratio, we need a common understanding of false alarms and a consistent use of terms and categories.},

  abstract = {Jamaica is the third largest island in the Caribbean. The epidemiology of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is important to Jamaica, particularly in the areas of health, tourism, and because of the potential impact on the local workforce and the economy. Data collected by the National Surveillance Unit on the prevalence of AGE transmitted by food are not accurate. To determine the true magnitude, risk factors, and the extent of underreporting of AGE in Jamaica, we conducted a cross-sectional, population-based retrospective survey during the periods of 21 February--7 March and 14-27 June 2009, corresponding to high- and low-AGE season respectively. Of the total 1,920 persons selected randomly by a multistage cluster-sampling process, 1,264 responded (response rate 65.8\%). Trained interviewers administered a standardized, validated questionnaire during face-to-face interviews. The overall prevalence of self-reported AGE was 4.0\% (95\% CI 2.9-5.1) at a rate of 0.5 episodes/per person-year. The highest monthly prevalence of AGE (14.6\%) was found among the 1-4 year(s) age-group and the lowest (2.1\%) among the 25-44 years age-group. Of the 18 cases (36\%) who sought medical care, 11\% were hospitalized, 33\% were treated with antibiotics, and 66.7\% received oral rehydration fluids. Only 2 cases who sought medical care reportedly submitted stool specimens. The mean duration of diarrhoea was 3.1 days, which resulted in a mean loss of 4 productive days, with over half of the cases requiring someone to care for them. The burden of syndromic AGE for 2009 was extrapolated to be 122,711 cases, showing an underreporting factor of 58.9. For every laboratory-confirmed AGE case, it was estimated that 383 more cases were occurring in the population. This research confirms that the prevalence of AGE is underreported in Jamaica and not being adequately detected by the current surveillance system. The components of the integrated surveillance system for AGE in Jamaica, particularly the laboratory aspect, need to be strengthened.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND We describe an outbreak of gastroenteritis and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli in Germany in May, June, and July, 2011. The consumption of sprouts was identified as the most likely vehicle of infection. METHODS We analyzed data from reports in Germany of Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli gastroenteritis and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome and clinical information on patients presenting to Hamburg University Medical Center (HUMC). An outbreak case was defined as a reported case of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome or of gastroenteritis in a patient infected by Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli, serogroup O104 or serogroup unknown, with an onset of disease during the period from May 1 through July 4, 2011, in Germany. RESULTS A total of 3816 cases (including 54 deaths) were reported in Germany, 845 of which (22\%) involved the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The outbreak was centered in northern Germany and peaked around May 21 to 22. Most of the patients in whom the hemolytic-uremic syndrome developed were adults (88\%; median age, 42 years), and women were overrepresented (68\%). The estimated median incubation period was 8 days, with a median of 5 days from the onset of diarrhea to the development of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Among 59 patients prospectively followed at HUMC, the hemolytic-uremic syndrome developed in 12 (20\%), with no significant differences according to sex or reported initial symptoms and signs. The outbreak strain was typed as an enteroaggregative Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli O104:H4, producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. CONCLUSIONS In this outbreak, caused by an unusual E. coli strain, cases of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome occurred predominantly in adults, with a preponderance of cases occurring in women. The hemolytic-uremic syndrome developed in more than 20\% of the identified cases.},

  abstract = {Campylobacter is a common cause of gastroenteritis in the United States. We conducted a population-based case-control study to determine risk factors for sporadic Campylobacter infection. During a 12-month study, we enrolled 1316 patients with culture-confirmed Campylobacter infections from 7 states, collecting demographic, clinical, and exposure data using a standardized questionnaire. We interviewed 1 matched control subject for each case patient. Thirteen percent of patients had traveled abroad. In multivariate analysis of persons who had not traveled, the largest population attributable fraction (PAF) of 24\% was related to consumption of chicken prepared at a restaurant. The PAF for consumption of nonpoultry meat that was prepared at a restaurant was also large (21\%); smaller proportions of illness were associated with other food and nonfood exposures. Efforts to reduce contamination of poultry with Campylobacter should benefit public health. Restaurants should improve food-handling practices, ensure adequate cooking of meat and poultry, and consider purchasing poultry that has been treated to reduce Campylobacter contamination.},

As an example, unhealthy food establishments may concentrate in some neighborhoods and, mediated by social and commercial drivers, increase local health risks. To understand the connections between neighborhood food environments and public health, researchers often use geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial statistics to analyze place-based evidence, but such tools require careful application and interpretation. In this article, we summarize the factors shaping neighborhood health in relation to local food environments and outline the use of GIS methodologies to assess associations between the two. We provide an overview of available data sources, analytical approaches, and their strengths and weaknesses. We postulate next steps in GIS integration with forecasting, prediction, and simulation measures to frame implications for local health policies.

  abstract = {Poor diets, including those high in fast food, are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Exposure to low-quality food environments, such as `food swamps' saturated with fast food outlets (FFO), is hypothesized to negatively impact diet and related disease. However, research linking such exposure to diet and health outcomes has generated mixed findings and led to unsuccessful policy interventions. A major research limitation has been a predominant focus on static food environments around the home, such as food deserts and swamps, and sparse availability of information on mobile food environments people are exposed to and food outlets they visit as they move throughout the day. In this work, we leverage population-scale mobility data to examine peoples' visits to food outlets and FFO in and beyond their home neighborhoods and to evaluate how food choice is influenced by features of food environments people are exposed to in their daily routines vs. individual preference. Using a semi-causal framework and various natural experiments, we find that 10\% more FFO in an area increases the odds of people visiting a FFO by approximately 20\%. This strong influence of the food environment happens similarly during weekends and weekdays, is largely independent of individual income. Using our results, we investigate multiple intervention strategies to food environments to promote reduced FFO visits. We find that optimal locations for intervention are a combination of where i) the prevalence of FFO is the highest, ii) most decisions about food outlet visits are made, and most importantly, iii) visitors' food decisions are most susceptible to the environment. Multi-level interventions at the individual behavior- and food environment-level that target areas combining these features could have 1.7x to 4x larger effects than traditional interventions that alter food swamps or food deserts.},

  abstract = {Food is traded across the global markets to satisfy consumer demands, mainly from developed countries, for year-round access to a wide range of foods. This has resulted in an increasingly complex network of food trade and has made importing countries vulnerable to the spread of foodborne disease outbreaks originating from "foreign" food networks. Analysis of these networks can provide information on potential food safety risks and also on the potential spread of these risks through the food network in question. In this study, network theory has been used to analyse global trade. A mathematical model was developed enabling a simulation of the distribution of food products based on the publicly available data on international imports, exports and production provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Through numerical simulations we demonstrate, for the first time, the impact that the network structure has on the distribution of food products in terms of food safety risks. As a case study, a recent trans-national food safety incident was analysed, illustrating the potential application of the model in a foodborne pathogen outbreak. Using only the type of contaminated food and the countries where the outbreak was reported, the model was used to identify the most likely origin of the contaminated eggs, narrowing down the options to three countries (including the actual origin). Furthermore, it is used to identify those countries with significant food safety risks, due to imports of food produced in these three countries. The approach can help regulatory agencies and the food industry to design improved surveillance and risk mitigation actions against transnational food safety risks.},

Approximate analytic arguments suggest that the optimal distribution of facilities should have a density that increases with population density, but does so slower than linearly, as the two-thirds power. This result is confirmed numerically for the particular case of the United States with recent population data using two independent methods, one a straightforward regression analysis, the other based on density dependent map projections. We also consider strategies for linking the facilities to form a spatial network, such as a network of flights between airports, so that the combined cost of maintenance of and travel on the network is minimized. We show specific examples of such optimal networks for the case of the United States.},

Such methods go well beyond the conventional 'nearest-neighbour' and 'quadrat' analyses which have little to offer in an epidemiological context because they fail to allow for spatial variation in population density. Correction for this is essential if the aim is to assess the evidence for 'clustering' of cases of disease. We examine methods for exploring spatial variation in disease risk, spatial and space-time clustering, and we consider methods for modelling the raised incidence of disease around suspected point sources of pollution. All methods are illustrated by reference to recent case studies including child cancer incidence, Burkitt's lymphoma, cancer of the larynx and childhood asthma. An Appendix considers a range of possible software environments within which to apply these methods. The links to modern geographical information systems are discussed.},

We conducted a simulation study to assess the frequency and determinants of recall errors. METHODS Lunch visitors in a cafeteria using exclusively cashless payment reported their consumption of 13 food servings available daily in the three preceding weeks using a self-administered paper-questionnaire. We validated this information using electronic payment information. We calculated associated factors on misclassification of recall according to time, age, sex, education level, dietary habits and type of servings. RESULTS We included 145/226 (64\%) respondents who reported 27,095 consumed food items. Sensitivity of recall was 73\%, specificity 96\%. In multivariable analysis, for each additional day of recall period, the adjusted chance for false-negative recall increased by 8\% (OR: 1.1;95\%-CI: 1.06, 1.1), for false-positive recall by 3\% (OR: 1.03;95\%-CI: 1.02, 1.05), for indecisive recall by 12\% (OR: 1.1;95\%-CI: 1.08, 1.15). Sex and education-level had minor effects. DISCUSSION Forgetting to report consumed foods is more frequent than reporting food-items actually not consumed. Bad recall is strongly enhanced by delay of interviews and may make hypothesis generation and testing very challenging. Side dishes are more easily missed than main courses. If available, electronic payment data can improve food-history information.},

The incidence of listeriosis in patients aged {$\geq$}60 years in England has doubled since 2001; hence, the investigation of risk factors for infection in this group is important to inform on prevention and control. Standardized epidemiological information has been sought on cases since 2005, but the value of the data accrued is limited without some perception of exposure prevalence in the population at risk of listeriosis. The exposures of listeriosis cases aged {$\geq$}60 years reported in England from 2005 to 2008 were compared to those of market research panel members representing the same population (i.e., residents of England aged {$\geq$}60 years) and time period. Exposures were grouped to facilitate comparison. Odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated. Cases were more likely than panel members to report the consumption of cooked meats (beef and ham/pork, but not poultry), cooked fish (specifically smoked salmon) and shellfish (prawns), dairy products (most noticeably milk but also certain cheeses), and mixed salads. They were less likely to report the consumption of other forms of seafood, dairy spread, other forms of dairy, sandwiches, and fresh vegetables. The diversity of high-risk food exposures reflects the ubiquity of the microorganism in the environment and/or the susceptibility of those at risk, and suggests that a wider variety of foods can give rise to listeriosis. Food safety advice on avoiding listeriosis should be adapted accordingly. While not inexpensive, the application of market research data to infectious disease epidemiology can add value to routine surveillance data.},

The biased comparisons that result can hamper or, worse, mislead investigators. Following a 2009 outbreak of Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 infection associated with a petting farm in southeast England, it was hypothesized that case behavior alone could be used to identify risks. Case-patients' exposures were randomized on a case-by-case basis, and the resulting permuted data were compared with the actual events preceding illness by conditional logistic regression analysis. There was good agreement between the risks identified by using our new method and the risks elicited in the original outbreak case-control studies. This was also the case in analysis of 2 further historical outbreaks. These initial findings suggest that the technique, which we have called the ``case-chaos'' technique, appeared to be useful in this setting. Analysis of simulated data supports this view. Circumventing the need for traditional control data has the potential to reduce outbreak investigation lead times, leading to earlier interventions and reduced morbidity and mortality. However, further validation is necessary, coupled with an awareness of limitations of the method.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of an outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis phage type 1 (PT1) infection associated with a fast food premises, and to identify the causative factors leading to an acute outbreak with high attack rate and severe illness including hospital admission. Study design: Integrated descriptive study of epidemiology, food and environmental microbiology, and professional environmental health assessment, supplemented by a case--case analytical study. Methods: Cases were identified through multiple sources and were interviewed to identify food items consumed. Descriptive epidemiology of all cases and a case--case analytical study of risk factors for severe illness were undertaken. Microbiological investigation included analysis and typing of pathogens from stools, blood and environmental surfaces. Professional environmental heath assessment of the premises was undertaken. Results: S. enteritidis PT1 was recovered from two-thirds of faecal samples. Three cases had dual infection with enterotoxin-producing Clostridium perfringens. S. enteritidis PT1 was isolated from 14 of 40 food samples examined and C. perfringens was isolated from eight food samples. Environmental health inspection of the premises revealed multiple deficiencies, including deficits in food preparation and hygiene consistent with multiple cross-contamination, and time-temperature abuse of sauces widely used across menu items. Severe cases were associated with consumption of chips and salad. Conclusions: Outbreaks from fast food premises have been infrequently described. This outbreak demonstrates the potential for fast food premises, with multiple deficiencies in food preparation and hygiene, to produce large, intense community outbreaks with high attack rates and severe illness, highly confined in space and time.},

  abstract = {Portugal has one of the highest levels of fish consumption globally. Raw or lightly processed fish is not part of the traditional diet but the rise in popularity of such dishes worldwide means that consumption of this type of food is likely to increase in Portugal. Anisakiosis is a food-borne zoonotic disease associated with consumption of raw or undercooked fish. An increase in reported incidence of the disease has occurred in recent decades. Our survey aimed to gather data on raw fish consumption in Portugal, looking at the sociodemographic and health characteristics of the individuals who consume raw fish (n~=~421), as well as the volume of raw fish consumed, species of fish consumed raw and types of raw fish dishes consumed. The volume of raw fish consumed by our survey population was 6.3~kg per person annually. It accounted for approximately 10\% of all fish consumed. Salmon or trout, tuna and cod were the species of fish most frequently consumed raw and the most popular raw fish dishes were sushi or sashimi and fish spiced with vinegar and lemon or marinated. Although the number of respondents with seafood allergies only accounted for 2.6\% of the study population, they were responsible for almost 7\% of the total volume of raw fish consumed. Based on the volume and species of raw fish consumed, anisakiosis does pose a risk to the Portuguese population, but it would appear to be quite small. Data on Anisakis spp. prevalence are limited for some of the species of fish consumed raw and further studies on these are warranted to better characterise the disease risk in the population studied. In addition, improved risk communication and consumer education campaigns should be implemented to minimize the risk to the Portuguese population from anisakiosis.},

In this paper, we present a simple compact way to model the transmission of infectious disease through transportation networks using widely available aggregate mobility data in the form of a zone-level origin-destination (OD) travel flow matrix. A key feature of our model is that it not only captures the propagation of infection via direct connections between zones (that is, first-order effects) as in existing studies, but also transmission effects that are due to subsequent interactions in the remainder of the system (that is, higher-order effects). We demonstrate the importance of capturing higher-order effects in a simulation study. We then apply our model to study the first wave of COVID-19 infections in Italy using real-time data on mobility between Italian provinces (that is, province-level OD data) and daily reported caseloads at the same geographical level. Our empirical results indicate substantial predictive power, particularly during early stages of an outbreak. At least 85-percent of the spatial variation in observed weekly province-level COVID-19 cases can be forecasted using our proposed model. Further, from on our model, we derive metrics that could help identify target areas for intervention, specifically during early outbreaks or resurgences of infectious diseases.},

Bayesian modeling provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty and incorporate both data and prior knowledge into the model estimates. Stan is an expressive probabilistic programming language that abstracts the inference and allows users to focus on the modeling. As a result, Stan code is readable and easily extensible, which makes the modeler's work more transparent. Furthermore, Stan's main inference engine, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, is amiable to diagnostics, which means the user can verify whether the obtained inference is reliable. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to formulate, fit, and diagnose a compartmental transmission model in Stan, first with a simple susceptible-infected-recovered model, then with a more elaborate transmission model used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also cover advanced topics which can further help practitioners fit sophisticated models; notably, how to use simulations to probe the model and priors, and computational techniques to scale-up models based on ordinary differential equations.},

Logistic regression has substantive limitations for analysing structured questionnaire data with numerous exposures and missing values. We adapted random forest to analyse data of a case-control study of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis illness for source attribution. For estimation of summary population attributable fractions (PAFs) of exposures grouped into transmission routes, we devised a counterfactual estimator to predict reductions in illness associated with removing grouped exposures. For the purpose of comparison, we fitted the data using logistic regression models with stepwise forward and backward variable selection. Our results show that the forward and backward variable selection of logistic regression models were not consistent for parameter estimation, with different significant exposures identified. By contrast, the random forest model produced estimated PAFs of grouped exposures consistent in rank order with results obtained from outbreak data, with egg-related exposures having the highest estimated PAF (22{$\cdot$}1\%, 95\% confidence interval 8{$\cdot$}5--31{$\cdot$}8). Random forest might be structurally more coherent and efficient than logistic regression models for attributing Salmonella illnesses to sources involving many causal pathways.},

  abstract = {he partitioning of pathogenic strains isolated in environmental or human cases to their sources is challenging. The pathogens usually colonize multiple animal hosts, including livestock, which contaminate the food-production chain and the environment (e.g. soil and water), posing an additional public-health burden and major challenges in the identification of the source. Genomic data opens up new opportunities for the development of statistical models aiming to indicate the likely source of pathogen contamination. Here, we propose a computationally fast and efficient multinomial logistic regression source-attribution classifier to predict the animal source of bacterial isolates based on `source-enriched' loci extracted from the accessory-genome profiles of a pangenomic dataset. Depending on the accuracy of the model's self-attribution step, the modeller selects the number of candidate accessory genes that best fit the model for calculating the likelihood of (source) category membership. The Accessory genes-Based Source Attribution (AB\_SA) method was applied to a dataset of strains of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and its monophasic variant (S. enterica 1,4,[5],12:i:-). The model was trained on 69 strains with known animal-source categories (i.e. poultry, ruminant and pig). The AB\_SA method helped to identify 8 genes as predictors among the 2802 accessory genes. The self-attribution accuracy was 80\%. The AB\_SA model was then able to classify 25 of the 29 S. enterica Typhimurium and S. enterica 1,4,[5],12:i:- isolates collected from the environment (considered to be of unknown source) into a specific category (i.e. animal source), with more than 85\% of probability. The AB\_SA method herein described provides a user-friendly and valuable tool for performing source-attribution studies in only a few steps. AB\_SA is written in R and freely available at https://github. com/lguillier/AB\_SA.},

Using human surveillance data on laboratory-confirmed Salmonella infections from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Salmonella testing data from U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service's regulatory programs, we developed a point-of-processing foodborne illness attribution model by adapting the Hald Salmonella Bayesian source attribution model. Key model outputs include estimates of the relative proportions of domestically acquired sporadic human Salmonella infections resulting from contamination of raw meat, poultry, and egg products processed in the United States from 1998 through 2003. The current model estimates the relative contribution of chicken (48\%), ground beef (28\%), turkey (17\%), egg products (6\%), intact beef (1\%), and pork ({$<$}1\%) across 109 Salmonella serotypes found in food commodities at point of processing. While interpretation of the attribution estimates is constrained by data inputs, the adapted model shows promise and may serve as a basis for a common approach to attribution of human salmonellosis and food safety decision-making in more than one country.},

Synchromodal transportation, as an extension of intermodal transportation, refers to transport systems with dynamic updating of plans by incorporating real-time information. The trend towards spot markets and digitalization in hinterland intermodal transportation gives rise to online synchromodal transportation problems. This paper investigates a dynamic shipment matching problem in which a centralized platform provides online matches between shipment requests and transport services. We propose a rolling horizon approach to handle newly arrived shipment requests and develop a heuristic algorithm to generate timely solutions at each decision epoch. The experiment results demonstrate the solution accuracy and computational efficiency of the heuristic algorithm in comparison to an exact algorithm. The proposed rolling horizon approach outperforms a greedy approach from practice in total costs under various scenarios of the system.},

Seventeen of the 35 cases identified in the outbreak were included in the study according to the availability of menu records with detailed information on food consumed at each meal. Food exposures during a 3-day risk period before onset of illness were compared to those of a control time-interval of the same duration that preceded the risk period by two days. Seventy-seven per cent of the cases (13/17) had consumed hamburgers in the three days preceding onset of illness compared with 29\% (5/17) during the control period (P = 0.04, odds ratio = 5, 95\% CI: 1.1-46.9).

  abstract = {Illness and death from diseases caused by contaminated food are a constant threat to public health and a significant impediment to socio-economic development worldwide. To measure the global and regional burden of foodborne disease (FBD), the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG), which here reports their first estimates of the incidence, mortality, and disease burden due to 31 foodborne hazards. We find that the global burden of FBD is comparable to those of the major infectious diseases, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The most frequent causes of foodborne illness were diarrheal disease agents, particularly norovirus and Campylobacter spp. Diarrheal disease agents, especially non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, were also responsible for the majority of deaths due to FBD. Other major causes of FBD deaths were Salmonella Typhi, Taenia solium and hepatitis A virus. The global burden of FBD caused by the 31 hazards in 2010 was 33 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs); children under five years old bore 40\% of this burden. The 14 subregions, defined on the basis of child and adult mortality, had considerably different burdens of FBD, with the greatest falling on the subregions in Africa, followed by the subregions in South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean D subregion. Some hazards, such as non-typhoidal S. enterica, were important causes of FBD in all regions of the world, whereas others, such as certain parasitic helminths, were highly localised. Thus, the burden of FBD is borne particularly by children under five years old-although they represent only 9\% of the global population-and people living in low-income regions of the world. These estimates are conservative, i.e., underestimates rather than overestimates; further studies are needed to address the data gaps and limitations of the study. Nevertheless, all stakeholders can contribute to improvements in food safety throughout the food chain by incorporating these estimates into policy development at national and international levels.},

This necessarily involves a careful consideration of the theoretical underpinnings since it has become clear that naive approaches to estimation lead to biased and frequently misinterpreted results. There are now several theory-consistent estimation methods and we argue against sole reliance on any one method and instead advocate a toolkit approach. One estimator may be preferred for certain types of data or research questions but more often the methods should be used in concert to establish robustness. In recent years, estimation has become just a first step before a deeper analysis of the implications of the results, notably in terms of welfare. We try to facilitate diffusion of best-practice methods by illustrating their application in a step-by-step cookbook mode of exposition.},

  abstract = {A major obstacle in the spatial analysis of infectious disease surveillance data is the problem of under-reporting. This article investigates the possibility of inferring reporting rates through joint statistical modelling of several infectious diseases with different aetiologies. Once variation in under-reporting can be estimated, geographic risk patterns for infections associated with specific food vehicles may be discerned. We adopt the shared component model, proposed by Knorr-Held and Best for two chronic diseases and further extended by (Held L, Natario I, Fenton S, Rue H, Becker N. Towards joint disease mapping. Statistical Methods in Medical Research 2005b; 14: 61-82) for more than two chronic diseases to the infectious disease setting. Our goal is to estimate a shared component, common to all diseases, which may be interpreted as representing the spatial variation in reporting rates. Additional components are introduced to describe the real spatial variation of the different diseases. Of course, this interpretation is only allowed under specific assumptions, in particular, the geographical variation in under-reporting should be similar for the diseases considered. In addition, it is vital that the data do not contain large local outbreaks, so adjustment based on a time series method recently proposed by (Held L, H{\"o}hle M, Hofmann M. A statistical framework for the analysis of multivariate infectious disease surveillance data. Statistical Modelling 2005a; 5: 187-99) is made at a preliminary stage. We will illustrate our approach through the analysis of gastrointestinal diseases notification data obtained from the German infectious disease surveillance system, administered by the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin.},

  abstract = {According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. Over the coming century, warming trends such as increased duration and frequency of heat waves and hot extremes are expected in some areas, as well as increased intensity of some storm systems. Climate-induced trends will impact the persistence and dispersal of foodborne pathogens in myriad ways, especially for environmentally ubiquitous and/or zoonotic microorganisms. Animal hosts of foodborne pathogens are also expected to be impacted by climate change through the introduction of increased physiological stress and, in some cases, altered geographic ranges and seasonality. This review article examines the effects of climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall, drought and wind, on the environmental dispersal and persistence of bacterial foodborne pathogens, namely, Bacillus cereus, Brucella, Campylobacter, Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio and Yersinia enterocolitica. These relationships are then used to predict how future climatic changes will impact the activity of these microorganisms in the outdoor environment and associated food safety issues. The development of predictive models that quantify these complex relationships will also be discussed, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on transmission of foodborne disease from animal hosts.},

  abstract = {Foodborne infection is a result of exposure to complex, dynamic food systems. The efficiency of foodborne infection is driven by ongoing shifts in genetic machinery. Next-generation sequencing technologies can provide high-fidelity data about the genetics of a pathogen. However, food safety surveillance systems do not currently provide similar high-fidelity epidemiological metadata to associate with genetic data. As a consequence, it is rarely possible to transform genetic data into actionable knowledge that can be used to genuinely inform risk assessment or prevent outbreaks. Big data approaches are touted as a revolution in decision support, and pose a potentially attractive method for closing the gap between the fidelity of genetic and epidemiological metadata for food safety surveillance. We therefore developed a simple food chain model to investigate the potential benefits of combining `big' data sources, including both genetic and high-fidelity epidemiological metadata. Our results suggest that, as for any surveillance system, the collected data must be relevant and characterize the important dynamics of a system if we are to properly understand risk: this suggests the need to carefully consider data curation, rather than the more ambitious claims of big data proponents that unstructured and unrelated data sources can be combined to generate consistent insight. Of interest is that the biggest influencers of foodborne infection risk were contamination load and processing temperature, not genotype. This suggests that understanding food chain dynamics would probably more effectively generate insight into foodborne risk than prescribing the hazard in ever more detail in terms of genotype.},

The sudden shift in food consumption patterns from food service to food retail required realignment of food supply chains. For the most part, food supply chains have performed remarkably well during the pandemic. Cross-border food supply chains have continued to function effectively. The most significant disruptions emerged from workforce outbreaks of COVID-19 in the meat processing sector and in fruit and vegetable production. The paper discusses supply chain resilience and argues that agrifood supply chains are characterized by several important differences that need to be taken into consideration when evaluating resilience. Economies of scale and scope offer economic efficiency advantages in normal times, while investments in adaptability and flexibility can enhance resilience for abnormal times. Potential long-run changes within supply chains include increased automation and digitalization in food supply chains, while investments in infrastructure for online delivery services have permanently altered the food retailing landscape.},

  abstract = {This report updates the USDA, Economic Research Service's (ERS) 2013 estimates of the economic burden for the 15 leading foodborne pathogens for inflation and income growth to 2018. USDA, ERS estimates of the economic burden of foodborne diseases include the costs of medical care, the value of lost productivity due to illness-induced absences from jobs, and the economic burden of premature deaths from foodborne illness. These estimates reflect the impact on consumers, not producers. Inflation and income growth result in a higher economic burden of foodborne illness, even holding constant disease incidence and health care use. We found that in 2018 dollars, the economic burden of these pathogens was \$17.6 billion, an increase of about \$2 billion, or 13 percent, over the 2013 USDA, ERS estimate of \$15.5 billion for the same 15 pathogens. Overall inflation from 2013 to 2018 was 7.8 percent, and real per capita gross domestic product (GDP) growth was 8.8 percent. This means the value of preventing these foodborne illnesses increased by about 5 percentage points more than overall inflation and 4 percentage points more than income over the 5-year period. This paper also explores the role of price inflation and income growth in driving changes in the economic burden of these illnesses.},

Knowing the relative role importance of different foods as exposure routes for key hazards is critical to preventing illness. This study reports the findings of a structured expert elicitation providing globally comparable food source attribution estimates for 11 major FBDs in each of 14 world subregions. Methods and findings We used Cooke's Classical Model to elicit and aggregate judgments of 73 international experts. Judgments were elicited from each expert individually and aggregated using both equal and performance weights. Performance weighted results are reported as they increased the informativeness of estimates, while retaining accuracy. We report measures of central tendency and uncertainty bounds on food source attribution estimate., For some pathogens we see relatively consistent food source attribution estimates across subregions of the world; for others there is substantial regional variation. For example, for non-typhoidal salmonellosis, pork was of minor importance compared to eggs and poultry meat in the American and African subregions, whereas in the European and Western Pacific subregions the importance of these three food sources were quite similar. Our regional results broadly agree with estimates from earlier European and North American food source attribution research. As in prior food source attribution research, we find relatively wide uncertainty bounds around our median estimates. Conclusions We present the first worldwide estimates of the proportion of specific foodborne diseases attributable to specific food exposure routes. While we find substantial uncertainty around central tendency estimates, we believe these estimates provide the best currently available basis on which to link FBDs and specific foods in many parts of the world, providing guidance for policy actions to control FBDs.},

We allow for lagged effects to echo back to the dominant region. London in turn is influenced by international developments through its link to New York and other financial centers. It is shown that New York house prices have a direct effect on London house prices. We analyse the effect of shocks using generalised spatio-temporal impulse responses.

For the case study the Ostrava region (CZ) was selected and delimited as a catchment with significant everyday commuting flows to Ostrava, observed in census 2011. The distribution of employers was constructed using the Albertina - Company Monitor. The number of employees in all companies within each municipality and each economical sector represents the attractiveness of municipalities as destinations in the gravity model. The origins in the gravity model are represented by municipalities. Their power to generate commuting flows i s directed by the population of employed inhabitants. The distances between municipalities were enumerated using road network analysis and substituted by railway distances if they were shorter. For selected economic sectors (i.e. processing industries, internal trade) the specific gravity models of regional daily commuting flows were calibrated. The calibration was based on observed commuting flows between municipalities for each economic sector adjusted for missing census' answers. Differences among sector gravity models are discussed. Their Root Mean Square Errors and Mean Errors show the overall fitness of models. The variabili ty of models' parameters generally corresponds to expected differences among economic sectors. Finally, extreme differences of observed and expected flows for each gravity model were analysed. The results prove the usefulness of applied improved gravity models to understand commuting conditions, discover drawbacks of existing public transport services and challenges to improve the current conditions towards better efficiency of transport organisation. The parameters of gravity models can be utilised in stochastic simulations of random commuting flows in the region.},

  abstract = {In the event of a large-scale outbreak of foodborne disease, conventional epidemiological approaches to identify the food-vector source are time-intensive and often inconclusive, generating unspecific hypotheses about frequently-consumed foods while contaminated items continues to cause illnesses. Alternative investigation tools are needed that can efficiently generate food-type hypotheses early in the investigation. We frame the problem of generating hypotheses about the food-type source as one of identifying the source network from a set of food-type networks (e.g. vegetables, eggs) that most likely gave rise to the observed illness distribution, given how the diffusion pattern relates to a particular network's structure. We introduce a normalized measure of the signal resonance in a network-outbreak combination that accounts for unique topological properties of supply networks, enabling direct comparison between signals across any set of food-type networks. We illustrate the method using a set of network models representing the supply of various food-types in Germany and demonstrate its accuracy in identifying the true food-type source through application to simulated outbreaks and a real-world outbreak, STEC O104:H4 carried by contaminated sprouts in 2011. By using food supply structure to discriminate between food-types, this method advances the field of data-scientific approaches to large-scale outbreak investigation, providing the first approach that can account for unique properties of foodborne contamination transmission through complex supply chains. Since it can be immediately applied in the event of a large-scale outbreak, we anticipate that it may better inform decision-maker responses during early stages of an investigation.},

  abstract = {In today's globally interconnected food system, outbreaks of foodborne disease can spread widely and cause considerable impact on public health. We study the problem of identifying the source of emerging large-scale outbreaks of foodborne disease; a crucial step in mitigating their proliferation. To solve the source identification problem, we formulate a probabilistic model of the contamination diffusion process as a random walk on a network and derive the maximum-likelihood estimator for the source location. By modelling the transmission process as a random walk, we are able to develop a novel, computationally tractable solution that accounts for all possible paths of travel through the network. This is in contrast to existing approaches to network source identification, which assume that the contamination travels along either the shortest or highest probability paths. We demonstrate the benefits of the multiple-paths approach through application to different network topologies, including stylized models of food supply network structure and real data from the 2011 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli outbreak in Germany. We show significant improvements in accuracy and reliability compared with the relevant state-of-the-art approach to source identification. Beyond foodborne disease, these methods should find application in identifying the source of spread in network-based diffusion processes more generally, including in networks not well approximated by tree-like structure.},

The proposed model, which is called the susceptible--exposed--infectious--recovered--susceptible with a vaccination state (SEIRS-V) model, illustrates the dynamics of malware propagation with respect to time in SFNs. The model considers the impact of software diversity to halt the outbreak of malware in networks. Using the SEIRS-V model, we derive the basic reproductive ratio that governs whether or not a malware is extinct. Furthermore, we calculate the number of diverse software packages installed on computer nodes that can be introduced as a parameter to prevent malware spreading. We accomplish the systematic analysis of the model and represent the local and global stability of malware-free equilibrium. Using numerical simulations, we examine the theoretical analysis. The effects of diversification and vaccination on the model are investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that the model is more effective than other existing models of malware propagation, in terms of reducing the density of infected node.},

During a foodborne illness outbreak, rapid identification of contaminated food is vital to minimize illness, loss and impact on society. Public health officials face a significant challenge and long delays in obtaining critical information to help identify a contaminated product using traditional methods such as surveys and questionnaires. We propose a novel approach mapping geo-coded sales data against geo-coded confirmed case reports, which has the potential to reduce the time required for foodborne illness investigation. Using real grocery retail scanner data with spatial information from Germany, we have implemented a likelihood-based framework to study how such spatial data can be used to accelerate the investigation during the early stages of an outbreak. Our analysis shows that after receiving as few as 10 laboratory confirmed case reports it is possible to narrow the investigation to approximately 12 suspect products with the contaminated product included in this subset 90\% of the time for approximately 80\% of food products studied.},

We applied nonlinear time series analysis (NLTS) to reconstruct annual dynamics of FDOs in US cattle markets from CDC outbreak data, live cattle futures market prices, and USDA cattle inventories from 1967--2018, and used reconstructed dynamics to detect causality. Reconstructed deterministic nonlinear market dynamics are endogenously unstable---not self-correcting, and cattle inventories drive futures prices and FDOs attributed to beef in temporal patterns linked to a multi-decadal cattle cycle undetected in daily/weekly price movements investigated previously. Benchmarking real-world dynamics with NLTS offers more informative and credible empirical modeling at the convergence of natural and economic sciences.},

This scenario could force manufacturers to be lenient toward food safety control intentionally, or unintentionally, and result in a major foodborne outbreak that causes health problems and economic loss. The estimated cost of food safety incidents for the economy of the United States is around \$7 billion per year which comes from notifying consumers, removing food from shelves, and paying damages as a result of lawsuits. Most other countries similarly have economic losses. Much of these losses represent lost markets, loss of consumer demand, litigation and company closures. Concrete steps are needed to improve safety of foods produced for local or overseas markets to avoid unexpected food scandals and economic losses.},

Common hypothesis generation methods described are analytic studies (64.8\%), descriptive epidemiology (33.7\%), food or environmental sampling (32.8\%) and facility inspections (27.9\%). The least common methods included the use of a single interviewer (0.4\%) and investigation of outliers (0.4\%). Most studies reported using two or more methods to generate hypotheses (81.2\%), with 29.2\% of studies reporting using four or more. The use of multiple different hypothesis generation methods both within and between outbreaks highlights the complexity of enteric illness outbreak investigations.

Market panel data were collected from two companies using retrospective internet-based surveys; these were compared with reference data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS). We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios to compare exposure to each of the 71 food items between the market panel and NDNS participants. We compared 2103 panel controls with 2696 reference participants. Adjusted for socio-demographic factors, exposure to 90\% of foods was statistically different between both panels and the reference data. However, these differences were likely to be of limited practical importance for 89\% of Panel A foods and 79\% of Panel B foods. Market panel food exposures were comparable with reference data for common food exposures but more likely to be different for uncommon exposures. This approach should be considered for outbreak investigation, in conjunction with other considerations such as population at risk, timeliness of response and study resources.},

An important component of foodborne illness outbreak investigations is determining the source of the outbreak vehicle through traceback investigations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is home to traceback investigation experts who use a standardized process to initiate, execute, and interpret the results of traceback investigations in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local partners. Traceback investigations of three outbreaks of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections linked to romaine lettuce in 2018 and 2019 were examined to demonstrate challenges, limitations, and opportunities for improvement. The three outbreaks resulted in a total of 474 illnesses, 215 hospitalizations, and 5 deaths. These illnesses were linked to the consumption of romaine lettuce from three distinct growing regions in Arizona and California. Some of the challenges encountered included the time it took to initiate a traceback, limited product-identifying information throughout the supply chain, lack of interoperability in record-keeping systems, and comingling of product from multiple suppliers. These challenges led to time delays in the identification of the farm source of the leafy greens and the inability to identify the root cause of contamination. Implementation of technology-enabled traceability systems, testing of these systems, and future regulations to incentivize adoption of traceability systems are some of the initiatives that will help address these challenges by improving traceback investigations and ultimately preventing foodborne illnesses and future outbreaks from occurring.

Previous molecular subtyping methods, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), were critical in detecting outbreaks that led to food safety improvements and declining incidence, but PFGE provides limited genetic resolution. A multiagency collaboration began performing real-time, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on all US Lm isolates from patients, food, and the environment in September 2013, posting sequencing data into a public repository. Compared with the year before the project began, WGS, combined with epidemiologic and product trace-back data, detected more listeriosis clusters and solved more outbreaks (2 outbreaks in pre-WGS year, 5 in WGS year 1, and 9 in year 2). Whole-genome multilocus sequence typing and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses provided equivalent phylogenetic relationships relevant to investigations; results were most useful when interpreted in context of epidemiological data. WGS has transformed listeriosis outbreak surveillance and is being implemented for other foodborne pathogens.},

Analytic case-control studies are primarily used in this identification stage by comparing exposures in cases and controls using logistic regression. Standard epidemiological analysis practice is not formally defined and the combination of currently applied methods is subject to issues such as response misclassification, missing values, multiple testing problems and small sample estimation problems resulting in biased and possibly misleading results. In this paper, we develop a formal Bayesian variable selection method to account for misclassified responses and missing covariates, which are common complications in food-borne outbreak investigations. We illustrate the implementation and performance of our method on a Salmonella Thompson outbreak in the Netherlands in 2012. Our method is shown to perform better than the standard logistic regression approach with respect to earlier identification of contaminated food products. It also allows relatively easy implementation of otherwise complex methodological issues.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food-borne disease outbreaks constitute a large health burden on society. One of the challenges when investigating such outbreaks is to trace the origin of the outbreak. In this study, we consider a network model to determine the spatial origin of the contaminated food product that caused the outbreak. METHODS: The network model we use replaces the classic geographic distance of a network by an effective distance so that two nodes connected by a long-range link may be more strongly connected than their geographic distance would suggest. Furthermore, the effective distance transforms complex spatial patterns into regular topological patterns, creating a means for easier identification of the origin of the spreading phenomenon. Because detailed information on food distribution is generally not available, the model uses the gravity model from economics: the flow of goods from one node to another increases with population size and decreases with the geographical distance between them. RESULTS: This effective distance network approach has been shown to perform well in a large Escherichia coli O104:H4 outbreak in Germany in 2011. In this article, we apply the same method to various food-borne disease outbreaks in the Netherlands. We found the effective distance network approach to fail in certain scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Great care should be taken as to whether the underlying network model correctly captures the spreading mechanism of the outbreak in terms of spatial scale and single or multiple source outbreak.},

Analysis of WGS data delivered an unprecedented level of strain discrimination when compared with multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis. The robustness of the WGS method ensured confidence in the microbiological identification of linked cases, even when epidemiological links were obscured. There was evidence that phylogeny derived from WGS data can be used to trace the geographical origin of an isolate. Further analysis of the phylogenetic data provided insight on the evolutionary context of emerging pathogenic strains. Publically available WGS data linked to the clinical, epidemiological and environmental context of the sequenced strain has improved trace back investigations during outbreaks. Expanding the use of WGS-based typing analysis globally will ensure the rapid implementation of interventions to protect public health, inform risk assessment and facilitate the management of national and international food-borne outbreaks of STEC O157:H7.},

Calculating a binomial trial requires background exposure data. We conducted case-control studies and binomial trials in two foodborne outbreaks and compared results. In both outbreaks, using binomial trials we found much less than a 5\% probability that the number of cases eating the suspected food vehicle would have occurred by chance. These results were comparable with results of the case-control studies, but with considerably less effort. When background exposure data are available, binomial trials are an efficient way to explore hypotheses that can be further tested by traceback efforts to identify a common source.},

For each product, the lactic acid bacterial counts were similar, although generally between ca. 0.5 and 1 log10 lower than the total bacterial counts, indicating that lactic acid bacteria were a majority in the microbiota of these products. While the median counts of toxigenic pathogens were generally very low ({$<$}\,1.0 log10 CFU/g), the maximum counts detected in some samples could reach up to ca. 3.0 log10 CFU/g for presumptive Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. No Listeria monocytogenes colonies were obtained in this investigation; however, other Listeria spp. were detected. Thus, the results show that a (re)contamination of these products by pathogenic bacteria can be a potential safety concern. Furthermore, the detection of presumptive B. cereus and the isolation of various Clostridium species from these products indicates that spore-formers may have survived the food processing and therefore, could pose a safety concern, which should be assessed in further studies.},

In the United States, over 60\% of foodborne illness outbreaks occur at restaurants and 97\% of outbreaks are limited to a single state. Despite this, we currently know little about restaurant outbreaks and in particular, single-state outbreaks are not well understood. We use Chipotle Mexican Grill's eight outbreaks (2015--2018) to evaluate the media and stock market responses to both single and multistate outbreaks. Using news and stock market data, we provide evidence that multistate outbreaks brought swift stock price declines and single-state outbreaks' impact depended on their timing, rather than their severity. Before Chipotle's more well-known, multistate outbreaks, the firm's single-state outbreaks brought little reporting and no financial losses, whereas after the multistate food safety events, single-state events resulted in national media coverage and large financial impacts. Our findings are consistent with the literature on food scares that can result in chronic low-level anxiety, which can bring about a large resurgence of concern for smaller outbreaks. The lessons learned from Chipotle's case underscore the importance of investment in outbreak prevention. [G14 (Information and Market Efficiency, Event Studies, Insider Trading)].},

The significant genes ranged in functionality from cellular signaling and transport, virulence, metabolism, and stress response, and included gene variables not considered as significant by the baseline model.

Recognition of these outbreaks was partially due to improvements in outbreak response and surveillance, partially attributable to whole genome sequencing and related tools. Depending on the pathogen and vehicle, the contamination events leading to these outbreaks could occur before, during, and after food processing. Important data for root cause analyses are not always available because of inadequate traceability records or sampling throughout production chains, and challenges in detecting low levels of potentially injured pathogens heterogeneously distributed in foods. Further understanding of pathogen behaviors in these foods will enable better risk assessments and improve pathogen control strategies.}

The National Environment Agency of Singapore (NEA) is the primary government agency responsible for monitoring and mitigating the food safety risks. In an effort to pro-actively monitor emerging food safety issues and to stay abreast with developments related to food safety in the world, NEA tracks the World Wide Web as a source of news feeds to identify food safety related articles. However, such information gathering is a difficult and time consuming process due to information overload. In this paper, we present FoodSIS, a system for end-to-end web information gathering for food safety. FoodSIS improves efficiency of such focused information gathering process with the use of machine learning techniques to identify and rank relevant content. We discuss the challenges in building such a system and describe how thoughtful system design and recent advances in machine learning provide a framework that synthesizes interactive learning with classification to provide a system that is used in daily operations. We conduct experiments and demonstrate that our classification approach results in improving the efficiency by average 35\% compared to a conventional approach and the ranking approach leads to average 16\% improvement in elevating the ranks of relevant articles.},

  abstract = {Foodborne disease outbreaks of recent years demonstrate that due to increasingly interconnected supply chains these type of crisis situations have the potential to affect thousands of people, leading to significant healthcare costs, loss of revenue for food companies, and---in the worst cases---death. When a disease outbreak is detected, identifying the contaminated food quickly is vital to minimize suffering and limit economic losses. Here we present a likelihood-based approach that has the potential to accelerate the time needed to identify possibly contaminated food products, which is based on exploitation of food products sales data and the distribution of foodborne illness case reports. Using a real world food sales data set and artificially generated outbreak scenarios, we show that this method performs very well for contamination scenarios originating from a single ``guilty'' food product. As it is neither always possible nor necessary to identify the single offending product, the method has been extended such that it can be used as a binary classifier. With this extension it is possible to generate a set of potentially ``guilty'' products that contains the real outbreak source with very high accuracy. Furthermore we explore the patterns of food distributions that lead to ``hard-to-identify'' foods, the possibility of identifying these food groups a priori, and the extent to which the likelihood-based method can be used to quantify uncertainty. We find that high spatial correlation of sales data between products may be a useful indicator for ``hard-to-identify'' products.},

To generate and test hypotheses about vehicles, investigators typically compare exposure prevalence among case-patients with the general population using a one-sample binomial test. We propose a Bayesian alternative that also accounts for uncertainty in the estimate of exposure prevalence in the reference population. We compared exposure prevalence in a 2020 outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 illnesses linked to leafy greens with 2018-2019 FoodNet Population Survey estimates. We ran prospective simulations using our Bayesian approach at three time points during the investigation. The posterior probability that leafy green consumption prevalence was higher than the general population prevalence increased as additional case-patients were interviewed. Probabilities were {$>$}0.70 for multiple leafy green items 2 weeks before the exact binomial p-value was statistically significant. A Bayesian approach to assessing exposure prevalence among cases could be superior to the one-sample binomial test typically used during foodborne outbreak investigations.},

  abstract = {Improper food processing is one of the major causes of foodborne illness. Accurate prediction of the thermal destruction rate of foodborne pathogens is therefore vital to ensure proper processing and food safety. When bacteria are subjected to pH and thermal stresses during growth, sublethal stresses can occur that may lead to differences in their subsequent tolerance to thermal treatment. As a preliminary study to test this concept, the current study evaluated the effect of prior pH and thermal stresses on thermal tolerance of Salmonella and Staphylococcus using a tryptic soy broth supplemented with yeast extract. Bacteria incubated at three pH values (6.0, 7.4, and 9.0) and four temperatures (15, 25, 35, and 45{$^\circ$}C) for 24~hr were subjected to thermal treatments at 55, 60, and 65{$^\circ$}C. At the end of each treatment time, bacterial suspensions were surface-plated on standard method agar for quantification of bacterial survival and further calculation of the thermal death decimal reduction time (D-value) and thermal destruction temperature (z-value). The effect of pH stress alone during the incubation on the thermal tolerance of both bacteria was generally insignificant. An increasing pattern of D-value was observed with the increment of thermal stress (incubation temperature). The bacteria incubated at 35{$^\circ$}C required the highest z-value to reduce the 90\% in D-values. Staphylococcus mostly displayed higher tolerance to thermal treatment than Salmonella. Although further research is needed to validate the current findings on food matrices, findings in this study clearly affirm that adaptation of bacteria to certain stresses may reduce the effectiveness of preservation procedures applied during later stage of food processing and storage.},

We used data from the national Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS) to assess the reproducibility of the survey results. Programs that participated in the survey accounted for approximately 23\% of the single-state foodborne illness outbreaks in restaurant settings reported to FDOSS during 2016 to 2018. Agencies that disclosed inspection results at the POS reported fewer outbreaks (mean = 0.29 outbreaks per 1,000 establishments) than those that disclosed results online (0.7) or not at all (1.0). Having any grading method for inspections was associated with fewer reported outbreaks than having no grading method. Agencies that used letter grades had the lowest numbers of outbreaks per 1,000 establishments. There was a positive association (correlation coefficient, R2 = 0.29) between the mean number of foodborne illness complaints per 1,000 establishments, per the survey, and the mean number of restaurant outbreaks reported to FDOSS (R2 = 0.29). This association was stronger for bacterial toxin-mediated outbreaks (R2 = 0.35) than for norovirus (R2 = 0.10) or Salmonella (R2 = 0.01) outbreaks. Our cross-sectional study findings are consistent with previous observations that linked the practice of posting graded inspection results at the POS with reduced occurrence of foodborne illnesses and outbreaks associated with restaurants. Support for foodborne illness surveillance programs and food regulatory activities at local health agencies is foundational for food safety systems coordinated at state and federal levels.},

The goal of this project was to identify clinical and demographic characteristics that can be used to predict the causative agent in an enteric disease outbreak and to use these data to develop an online tool for investigators to use during an outbreak when hypothesizing about the causative agent. Using data on enteric disease outbreaks from all transmission routes (animal contact, environmental contamination, foodborne, person-to-person, waterborne, unknown) reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we developed random forest models to predict the etiology of an outbreak based on aggregated clinical and demographic characteristics at both the etiology category (i.e., bacteria, parasites, toxins, viruses) and individual etiology (Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, norovirus, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, and Shigella) levels. The etiology category model had a kappa of 0.85 and an accuracy of 0.92, whereas the etiology-specific model had a kappa of 0.75 and an accuracy of 0.86. The highest sensitivities in the etiology category model were for bacteria and viruses; all categories had high specificities ({$>$}0.90). For the etiology-specific model, norovirus and Salmonella had the highest sensitivity and all etiologies had high specificities. When laboratory confirmation is unavailable, information on the clinical signs and symptoms reported by people associated with the outbreak, with other characteristics including case demographics and illness severity, can be used to predict the etiology or etiology category. An online publicly available tool was developed to assist investigators in their enteric disease outbreak investigations.},

This rapidly developing field has focused heavily on vertebrates, and expansion of this scope to the study of infectious diseases holds great potential for landscape geneticists and disease ecologists alike. The potential application of landscape genetics to infectious agents has garnered attention at formative stages in the development of landscape genetics, but systematic examination is lacking. We comprehensively review how landscape genetics is being used to better understand pathogen dynamics. We characterize the field and evaluate the types of questions addressed, approaches used and systems studied. We also review the now established landscape genetic methods and their realized and potential applications to disease ecology. Lastly, we identify emerging frontiers in the landscape genetic study of infectious agents, including recent phylogeographic approaches and frameworks for studying complex multihost and host-vector systems. Our review emphasizes the expanding utility of landscape genetic methods available for elucidating key pathogen dynamics (particularly transmission and spread) and also how landscape genetic studies of pathogens can provide insight into host population dynamics. Through this review, we convey how increasing awareness of the complementarity of landscape genetics and disease ecology among practitioners of each field promises to drive important cross-disciplinary advances.},

Foodborne outbreaks caused by gastrointestinal bacteria such as Salmonella Typhimurium are among the most commonly reported and most extensively investigated. The classic outbreak investigation follows a series of well-defined steps which lead to a faster confirmation of the source and hopefully preventing of further cases. These steps are ideally undertaken using a One Health cross-sectorial collaboration approach involving partners from public health, food safety, and the veterinary and environmental sectors. In order to firmly identify the source of the outbreak, descriptive epidemiology is often combined with more robust evidence from analytical epidemiology such as a case-control study. A case-control study assesses whether a specific exposure is associated with illness, firstly by identifying cases (persons known to have been ill) and controls (persons who have not been ill, used as a reference group), and then retrospectively through interviews determining specific exposures for all persons. This information ultimately leads to the calculation of an odds ratio (see Note 3) which indicates the strength of the association between specific exposures and the outcome (illness or no illness). A well-conducted case-control study may substantiate or form core evidence as to the vehicle of a foodborne outbreak and is often a very important investigation tool, particularly in situations where microbiological proof cannot be obtained.},

  abstract = {During a foodborne crisis, risk assessors are often scrambling to assemble data needed to trace suspected foods along very complex supply chains. Although traceability systems ensure that stakeholders in the supply chain record lot-specific trace-back and trace-forward data, there are few databases available that describe in detail the flow of product in the complex web of supply chains. This paper presents the methodological approach used to design and assemble a relational database of nation-wide trade data for packaged ready-to-eat lettuce and leafy greens. The database was used in the development of an integrated simulation tool (Canadian GIS-based Risk Assessment, Simulation and Planning for food safety tool, i.e. CanGRASP) that can predict the spatial distribution and public health risk associated with contaminated food. The database includes the geographical coordinates of 5 domestic processors, 28 produce distribution centres and 2946 retail outlets from five of the top ten retail chains in Canada. It also includes other critical information to predict the fate of pathogens during distribution of contaminated product through the supply chain including: (a) product volumes handled by each stakeholder, (b) flow of product between stakeholders, (c) temperatures of product each season, and (d) times products spend in each step or during transit between steps, for each season. The database is used by both the simulation and mapping components of the integrated simulation tool during risk assessment exercises associated with emergency preparedness planning and training. Using the database, CanGRASP was able to assess the spread of the population at risk during a simulation of a hypothetical outbreak caused by fresh-cut leafy vegetables contaminated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the Canadian food distribution systems during both summer and winter seasons.},

We evaluate maximum likelihood, profile likelihood, iteratively reweighted least squares, and a hierarchical Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques under these distance-odds models. We compare these methods using an extensive simulation study and show that with multiple parameters and a nonlinear model, Bayesian methods have advantages in terms of estimation stability, precision, and interpretation.

Focusing on the study of cholera and diseases with similar modes of transmission, we calibrate the parameters of our mixture model using human mobility networks within a stochastic, spatially explicit epidemiological model for waterborne disease. Furthermore, we adopt a Bayesian perspective, so that prior information on source location can be incorporated (e.g., reflecting the impact of local conditions). Posterior-based inference is performed, which permits estimates in the form of either individual locations or regions. Importantly, our estimator only requires first-arrival times of the epidemic by putative observers, typically located only at a small proportion of nodes. The proposed method is demonstrated within the context of the 2000-2002 cholera outbreak in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.},

These food supply chains are critical to our food security, making it important to evaluate them. However, detailed spatial information on food flows within countries is rare. The goal of this paper is to estimate food flows between all county pairs within the United States. To do this, we develop the Food Flow Model, a data-driven methodology to estimate spatially explicit food flows. The Food Flow Model integrates machine learning, network properties, production and consumption statistics, mass balance constraints, and linear programming. Specifically, we downscale empirical information on food flows between 132 Freight Analysis Framework locations (17 292 potential links) to the 3142 counties and county-equivalents of the United States (9869 022 potential links). Subnational food flow estimates can be used in future work to improve our understanding of vulnerabilities within a national food supply chain, determine critical infrastructures, and enable spatially detailed footprint assessments.},

When the information refers to a particular node at which both quantities are measured, the model can be taken as a model for gossip propagation. In this context, we apply the model to real empirical networks of social acquaintances and compare the underlying spreading dynamics with different types of scale-free and small-world networks. We find that the number of friendship connections strongly influences the probability of being gossiped. Finally, we discuss how the spread factor is able to be applied to other situations.},

The project firstly attempted to identify existing flaws and needs, and then to provide applicable cross-sectorial solutions. The project focused in developing a platform for small countries with limited economical and personnel resources. To achieve these goals, we applied a user-centered design strategy involving the end-users, such as microbiologists in public health and veterinary authorities, in every step of the design, development and implementation phases. As a result, we delivered the INNUENDO Platform V1.0 (https://innuendo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a stand-alone, portable, open-source, end-to-end system for the management, analysis, and sharing of bacterial genomic data. The platform uses Nextflow workflow manager to assemble analytical software modules in species-specific protocols that can be run using a user-friendly interface. The reproducibility of the process is ensured by using Docker containers and throught the annotation of the whole process using an ontology. Several modules, available at https://github.com/TheInnuendoProject, have been developed including: genome assembly and species confirmation; fast genome clustering; in silico typing; standardized species-specific phylogenetic frameworks for Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli based on an innovative gene-by-gene methodology; quality control measures from raw reads to allele calling; reporting system; a built-in communication protocols and a strain classification system enabling smooth communication during outbreak investigation. As proof-of-concepts, the proposed solutions have been thoroughly tested in simulated outbreak conditions by several public health and veterinary agencies across Europe. The results have been widely disseminated through several channels (web-sites, scientific publications, organization of workshops). The INNUENDO Platform V1.0 is effectively one of the models for the usage of open-source software in genomic epidemiology.},

We compared the performance of these instruments by sequencing an isolate of Escherichia coli O104:H4, which caused an outbreak of food poisoning in Germany in 2011. The MiSeq had the highest throughput per run (1.6 Gb/run, 60 Mb/h) and lowest error rates. The 454 GS Junior generated the longest reads (up to 600 bases) and most contiguous assemblies but had the lowest throughput (70 Mb/run, 9 Mb/h). Run in 100-bp mode, the Ion Torrent PGM had the highest throughput (80--100 Mb/h).

Both control groups were frequency-matched to cases by age and sex; the classical controls also by federal state. Cases and controls were queried mainly about fruit consumption since melons were the suspected infection vehicle. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) using single-variable and multivariable logistic regression. The study included 32 cases, 81 panel controls and 110 classical controls. Analyses identified melons, particularly Galia melons, as the most likely infection vehicle using either control group (panel controls -- aOR 12, CI 2.7--66; classical controls -- aOR 55, CI 8--1100). Recruitment of panel versus classical controls required substantially less person-time (8 vs. 111~hours) and was about 10 times less expensive.

We consider the problem of estimating the infection sources and the infection regions (subsets of nodes infected by each source) in a network, based only on knowledge of which nodes are infected and their connections, and when the number of sources is unknown a priori. We derive estimators for the infection sources and their infection regions based on approximations of the infection sequences count. We prove that if there are at most two infection sources in a geometric tree, our estimator identifies the true source or sources with probability going to one as the number of infected nodes increases. When there are more than two infection sources, and when the maximum possible number of infection sources is known, we propose an algorithm with quadratic complexity to estimate the actual number and identities of the infection sources. Simulations on various kinds of networks, including tree networks, small-world networks and real world power grid networks, and tests on two real data sets are provided to verify the performance of our estimators.},

Source attribution of zoonoses is an important goal for infection control as is identification of isolates in reservoir hosts that represent a threat to human health. In this study, host specificity and zoonotic potential were predicted using machine learning in which Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were built based on predicted proteins from whole genome sequences. Analysis of over 1000 S. enterica genomes allowed the correct prediction (67 --90 \% accuracy) of the source host for S. Typhimurium isolates and the same classifier could then differentiate the source host for alternative serovars such as S. Dublin. A key finding from both phylogeny and SVM methods was that the majority of isolates were assigned to host-specific sub-clusters and had high host-specific SVM scores. Moreover, only a minor subset of isolates had high probability scores for multiple hosts, indicating generalists with genetic content that may facilitate transition between hosts. The same approach correctly identified human versus bovine E. coli isolates (83 \% accuracy) and the potential of the classifier to predict a zoonotic threat was demonstrated using E. coli O157. This research indicates marked host restriction for both S. enterica and E. coli, with only limited isolate subsets exhibiting host promiscuity by gene content. Machine learning can be successfully applied to interrogate source attribution of bacterial isolates and has the capacity to predict zoonotic potential.},

  abstract = {With the ever-expanding number of available sequences from bacterial genomes, and the expectation that this data type will be the primary one generated from both diagnostic and research laboratories for the foreseeable future, then there is both an opportunity and a need to evaluate how effectively computational approaches can be used within bacterial genomics to predict and understand complex phenotypes, such as pathogenic potential and host source. This article applied various quantitative methods such as diversity indexes, pangenome-wide association studies (GWAS) and dimensionality reduction techniques to better understand the data and then compared how well unsupervised and supervised machine learning (ML) methods could predict the source host of the isolates. The study uses the example of the pangenomes of 1203 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates in order to predict 'host of isolation' using these different methods. The article is aimed as a review of recent applications of ML in infection biology, but also, by working through this specific dataset, it allows discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of the different techniques. As with all such sub-population studies, the biological relevance will be dependent on the quality and diversity of the input data. Given this major caveat, we show that supervised ML has the potential to add real value to interpretation of bacterial genomic data, as it can provide probabilistic outcomes for important phenotypes, something that is very difficult to achieve with the other methods.},

  abstract = {Objectives Access to safe and nutritious food is essential for good health. However, food can become unsafe due to contamination with pathogens, chemicals or toxins, or mislabeling of allergens. Illness resulting from the consumption of unsafe foods is a global health problem. Here, we develop a machine learning approach for detecting reports of unsafe food products in consumer product reviews from Amazon.com. Materials and Methods We linked Amazon.com food product reviews to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food recalls from 2012 to 2014 using text matching approaches in a PostGres relational database. We applied machine learning methods and over- and under-sampling methods to the linked data to automate the detection of reports of unsafe food products. Results Our data consisted of 1 297 156 product reviews from Amazon.com. Only 5149 (0.4\%) were linked to recalled food products. Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformations performed best in identifying unsafe food reviews, achieving an F1 score, precision and recall of 0.74, 0.78, and 0.71, respectively. We also identified synonyms for terms associated with FDA recalls in more than 20 000 reviews, most of which were associated with nonrecalled products. This might suggest that many more products should have been recalled or investigated. Discussion and Conclusion Challenges to improving food safety include, urbanization which has led to a longer food chain, underreporting of illness and difficulty in linking contaminated food to illness. Our approach can improve food safety by enabling early identification of unsafe foods which can lead to timely recall thereby limiting the health and economic impact on the public.},

Standard public health procedures typically use case-control studies and tracings along food shipping chains. These methods are time-consuming and suffer from biased data collected slowly in patient interviews. Here we apply a recently developed, network-theoretical method to identify the spatial origin of food-borne disease outbreaks. Thereby, the network captures the transportation routes of contaminated foods. The technique only requires spatial information on case reports regularly collected by public health institutions and a model for the underlying food distribution network. The approach is based on the idea of replacing the conventional geographic distance with an effective distance that is derived from the topological structure of the underlying food distribution network. We show that this approach can efficiently identify most probable epicenters of food-borne disease outbreaks. We assess and discuss the method in the context of the 2011 EHEC epidemic. Based on plausible assumptions on the structure of the national food distribution network, the approach can correctly localize the origin of the 2011 German EHEC/HUS outbreak.},

In addition, higher volunteer engagement is positively related to a firefighter's intention to continue volunteering and to recruit others. Taken together, the results indicate that transformational leaders achieve positive volunteer outcomes by strengthening the organizational ties of volunteers and by connecting volunteers with the prosocial impact of their work. Theoretical implications for transformational leadership research in volunteer settings as well as practical recommendations for a sustainable volunteer management are provided.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nontyphoidal Salmonella causes {\textasciitilde}1 million food-borne infections annually in the United States. We began investigating a multistate outbreak of Salmonella serotype Agona infections in April 2011. METHODS: A case was defined as infection with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Agona occurring between 1 January and 25 August 2011. We developed hypotheses through iterative interviews. Product distribution analyses and traceback investigations were conducted. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tested papayas from Mexico for Salmonella. RESULTS: We identified 106 case patients from 25 states. Their median age was 21 years (range, 1-91). Thirty-nine of 61 case patients (64\%) reported Hispanic/Latino ethnicity; 11 of 65 (17\%) travelled to Mexico before illness. Thirty-two of 56 case patients (57\%) reported papaya consumption. Distribution analyses revealed that three firms, including Distributor A, distributed papaya to geographic areas that aligned with both the location and timing of illnesses. Traceback of papayas purchased by ill persons in four states identified Distributor A as the common supplier. FDA testing isolated the outbreak strain from a papaya sample collected at distributor A and from another sample collected at the US-Mexico border, destined for distributor A. FDA isolated Salmonella species from 62 of 388 papaya import samples (16\%). The investigation led to a recall of fresh, whole papayas from Distributor A and an FDA import alert for all papayas from Mexico. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported Salmonella outbreak in the United States linked to fresh, whole papayas. The outbreak highlights important issues regarding the safety of imported produce.},

To its adherents, it is an elegant statement about learning from experience. To its opponents, it is subjectivity run amok. In the first-ever account of Bayes' rule for general readers, Sharon Bertsch McGrayne explores this controversial theorem and the human obsessions surrounding it. She traces its discovery by an amateur mathematician in the 1740s through its development into roughly its modern form by French scientist Pierre Simon Laplace. She reveals why respected statisticians rendered it professionally taboo for 150 years---at the same time that practitioners relied on it to solve crises involving great uncertainty and scanty information, even breaking Germany's Enigma code during World War II, and explains how the advent of off-the-shelf computer technology in the 1980s proved to be a game-changer. Today, Bayes' rule is used everywhere from DNA de-coding to Homeland Security.

We report here on temperature profiles measured in winter and summer months in a retail supply chain and their predicted impact on the fate of the pathogen in fresh-cut lettuce. Time and temperature data were recorded in individual packages within cases of lettuce in the bottom, middle and top layers of pallets distributed from a processing facility to retail storage. Measurements indicated there were occasional increases in temperature during either season and that temperatures were {$\geq$}5~{$^\circ$}C for longer periods of time during the summer. A stochastic simulation model based on time and temperature distributions was constructed in @RISK™ to predict the fate of E.~coli O157:H7. The output from the model demonstrated a range of possible outcomes for the time-temperature profiles measured in the commercial supply chain, ranging from slight growth to die-off. The outputs of the stochastic simulations were similar to analytical simulations based on actual times and temperatures experienced by product in the supply chain. The distributions presented in the current model could be incorporated in quantitative risk assessments to improve predictions about the prevalence and fate of E.~coli O157:H7 in fresh-cut lettuce supply chains.},

This study examines the degree to which the joint effects of air pollution and N-SES on the cognitive decline are mediated by high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure (HBP), and depression. In the Emory Healthy Aging Study, 14,390 participants aged 50+ years from Metro Atlanta, GA, were assessed for subjective cognitive decline using the cognitive function instrument (CFI). Information on the prior diagnosis of high cholesterol, HBP, and depression was collected through the Health History Questionnaire. Participants' census tracts were assigned 3-year average concentrations of 12 air pollutants and 16~N-SES characteristics. We used the unsupervised clustering algorithm Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to create 6 exposure clusters based on the joint distribution of air pollution and N-SES in each census tract. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effects of the SOM cluster indicator on CFI, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, and neighborhood residential stability. The proportion of the association mediated by high cholesterol levels, HBP, and depression was calculated by comparing the total and direct effects of SOM clusters on CFI. Depression mediated up to 87~\% of the association between SOM clusters and CFI. For example, participants living in the high N-SES and high air pollution cluster had CFI scores 0.05 (95~\%-CI:0.01,0.09) points higher on average compared to those from the high N-SES and low air pollution cluster; after adjusting for depression, this association was attenuated to 0.01 (95~\%-CI:-0.04,0.05). HBP mediated up to 8~\% of the association between SOM clusters and CFI and high cholesterol up to 5~\%. Air pollution and N-SES associated cognitive decline was partially mediated by depression.

However, when a company rewards the recruitment of a new customer, managers are unaware of whether the rewarded referral was actually necessary or whether ``reward-scrounging'' has occurred because the referral receiver would have converted anyway. As a consequence, companies risk overestimating the effectiveness of their referral programs, which is why gaining insights into how and when reward-scrounging occurs is crucial. In this study, we employ a large data set from the telecommunications industry to analyze the drivers of reward-scrounging. The results indicate that reward-scrounging reduces the effectiveness of referral reward programs over time and that its likelihood depends on both the referral sender's network position and the company's marketing activities. The findings are used to develop managerial means to alleviate the negative effects of reward-scrounging.},

In March 2016, additional isolates from new cases were identified that shared a recent common ancestor with the outbreak strain. A case--case study involving the cases identified in 2016 revealed that ovine exposures were associated with illness (n = 16; AOR 8{$\cdot$}24; 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}55--39{$\cdot$}74). By mapping the recent movement of sheep and lambs across the United Kingdom, epidemiological links were established between the cases reporting ovine exposures. Given the close phylogenetic relationship between the outbreak strain and the isolates from cases with ovine exposures, it is plausible that ovine faeces may have contaminated the salad leaves via untreated irrigation water or run-off from fields nearby. Timely and targeted veterinary and environmental sampling should be considered during foodborne outbreaks of STEC, particularly where ready to eat vegetables and salads are implicated.},

Aim: Describe the use of consumer purchase datasets in outbreak investigations and consider methodological and practical difficulties.  Methods: We reviewed published papers describing the use of consumer purchase datasets, where electronic data on the foods that case-patients had purchased before onset of symptoms were obtained and analysed as part of outbreak investigations.  Results: For the period 2006-17, scientific articles were found describing 20 outbreak investigations. Most outbreaks involved salmonella or Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and were performed in eight different countries. The consumer purchase datasets were most frequently used to generate hypotheses about the outbreak vehicle where case-interviews had not been fruitful. Secondly, they were used to aid trace-back investigation, where a vehicle was already suspected. A number of methodological as well as (in some countries) legal and practical impediments exist.  Conclusions: Several of the outbreaks were unlikely to have been solved without the use of consumer purchase datasets. The method is potentially powerful and with future improved access to big data purchase information, may become a widely applicable tool for outbreak investigations, enabling investigators to quickly find hypotheses and at the same time estimate odds ratios or relative risks hereof. We suggest using the term 'consumer purchase data' to refer to the approach in the future.},

These developments include new classes of spatial point process models such as determinantal point processes, models incorporating both regularity and aggregation, and models where points are randomly distributed around latent geometric structures. Regarding parametric inference, the main focus is on various types of estimating functions derived from so-called innovation measures. Optimality of such estimating functions is discussed, as well as computational issues. Maximum likelihood inference for determinantal point processes and Bayesian inference are also briefly considered. Concerning nonparametric inference, we consider extensions of functional summary statistics to the case of inhomogeneous point processes as well as new approaches to simulation-based inference.},

We deployed a web-survey by email to targeted members of a market research panel (panel controls) in parallel to the outbreak control team interviewing randomly selected public health staff by telephone and completing paper-based questionnaires (staff controls). Recruitment and completion of exposure history web-surveys for panel controls (n = 123) took 14 h compared to 15 days for staff controls (n = 82). The average staff-time cost per questionnaire for staff controls was {\pounds}13{$\cdot$}13 compared to an invoiced cost of {\pounds}3{$\cdot$}60 per panel control. Differences in the distribution of some exposures existed between these control groups but case-control studies using each group found that illness was associated with consumption of chicken outside of the home and chicken from local butchers. Recruiting market research panel controls offers time and resource savings. More rapid investigations would enable more prompt implementation of control measures. We recommend that this method of recruiting controls is considered in future investigations and assessed further to better understand strengths and limitations.},

After an initial evaluation of using online market research panel members as controls in a case--control study to investigate a Salmonella outbreak in 2013, this method was applied in four further studies in the UK between 2014 and 2016. We used data from all five studies and interviews with members of each outbreak control team and market research panel provider to review operational issues, evaluate risk of bias in this approach and consider methods to reduce confounding and bias. The investigators of each outbreak reported likely time and cost savings from using market research controls. There were systematic differences between case and control groups in some studies but no evidence that conclusions on the likely source or vehicle of infection were incorrect. Potential selection biases introduced by using this sampling frame and the low response rate are unclear. Methods that might reduce confounding and some bias should be balanced with concerns for overmatching. Further evaluation of this approach using comparisons with traditional methods and population-based exposure survey data is recommended.},

  abstract = {Scant research focuses on the resiliency of food supply chain networks to outbreaks, despite the estimated 600 million global foodborne illnesses annually. Outbreaks that cross country, state and provincial lines are virulent due to the number of people they can affect and difficulty controlling them. Research is needed on food supply chain networks, which are not well-characterized in relation to foodborne illnesses or generally. This paper introduces the United States Food, Energy, and State Transportation (US-FEAST) model and demonstrates its applicability via analysis of a hypothetical demand shock resulting from multistate food contamination. US-FEAST is an optimization-based model across all fifty states with yearly timesteps to 2030. It is a framework integrating food system data from multiple individual data sources. To calibrate, we develop a bilevel optimization routine to generate synthetic, state-level data and provide estimates of otherwise unavailable data at the intersections of the food and transportation systems. The results of US-FEAST elucidate potential heterogenous state-level variations in response, regional changes in food flows, vulnerabilities in the supply chain, and implications for food system resilience. While the generated data and scenarios are not empirical evidence, they provide insights to aid in planning by projecting outcomes and intervention effects. Our results estimate a 23\% beef production decrease and 4\% price decrease provide a road map toward data needs for quantifying food system resilience to foodborne illness. US-FEAST and its framework may have global utility for studying food safety in national and international food supply chain networks.},

These studies provide empirical data for modelling frameworks that synthetize the quantitative evidence at our disposal and reduce reliance on expert elicitations. Here, we develop a statistical model within a Bayesian estimation framework to integrate attribution estimates from expert elicitations with estimates from microbial subtyping and case-control studies for sporadic infections with four major bacterial zoonotic pathogens in the Netherlands (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli [STEC] O157 and Listeria). For each pathogen, we pooled the published fractions of human cases attributable to each animal reservoir from the microbial subtyping studies, accounting for the uncertainty arising from the different typing methods, attribution models, and year(s) of data collection. We then combined the population attributable fractions (PAFs) from the case-control studies according to five transmission pathways (domestic food, environment, direct animal contact, human--human transmission and travel) and 11 groups within the foodborne pathway (beef/lamb, pork, poultry meat, eggs, dairy, fish/shellfish, fruit/vegetables, beverages, grains, composite foods and food handlers/vermin). The attribution estimates were biologically plausible, allowing the human cases to be attributed in several ways according to reservoirs, transmission pathways and food groups. All pathogens were predominantly foodborne, with Campylobacter being mostly attributable to the chicken reservoir, Salmonella to pigs (albeit closely followed by layers), and Listeria and STEC O157 to cattle. Food-wise, the attributions reflected those at the reservoir level in terms of ranking. We provided a modelling solution to reach consensus attribution estimates reflecting the empirical evidence in the literature that is particularly useful for policy-making and is extensible to other pathogens and domains.},

  abstract = {Prevention of the emergence and spread of foodborne diseases is an important prerequisite for the improvement of public health. Source attribution models link sporadic human cases of a specific illness to food sources and animal reservoirs. With the next generation sequencing technology, it is possible to develop novel source attribution models. We investigated the potential of machine learning to predict the animal reservoir from which a bacterial strain isolated from a human salmonellosis case originated based on whole-genome sequencing. Machine learning methods recognize patterns in large and complex data sets and use this knowledge to build models. The model learns patterns associated with genetic variations in bacteria isolated from the different animal reservoirs. We selected different machine learning algorithms to predict sources of human salmonellosis cases and trained the model with Danish Salmonella Typhimurium isolates sampled from broilers (n = 34), cattle (n = 2), ducks (n = 11), layers (n = 4), and pigs (n = 159). Using cgMLST as input features, the model yielded an average accuracy of 0.783 (95\% CI: 0.77--0.80) in the source prediction for the random forest and 0.933 (95\% CI: 0.92--0.94) for the logit boost algorithm. Logit boost algorithm was most accurate (valid accuracy: 92\%, CI: 0.8706--0.9579) and predicted the origin of 81\% of the domestic sporadic human salmonellosis cases. The most important source was Danish produced pigs (53\%) followed by imported pigs (16\%), imported broilers (6\%), imported ducks (2\%), Danish produced layers (2\%), Danish produced cattle and imported cattle ({$<$}1\%) while 18\% was not predicted. Machine learning has potential for improving source attribution modeling based on sequence data. Results of such models can inform risk managers to identify and prioritize food safety interventions.},

Information about the source of the bacteria guides risk managers on control and preventive strategies. Source attribution is the effort to quantify the number of sporadic human cases of a specific illness to specific sources and animal reservoirs. Source attribution methods for Salmonella have so far been based on traditional wet-lab typing methods. With the change to whole genome sequencing there is a need to develop new methods for source attribution based on sequencing data. Four European datasets collected in Denmark (DK), Germany (DE), the United Kingdom (UK) and France (FR) are presented in this descriptor. The datasets contain sequenced samples of Salmonella typhimurium and its monophasic variants isolated from human, food, animal and the environment. the objective of the datasets was either to attribute the human salmonellosis cases to animal reservoirs or to investigate contamination of the environment by attributing the environmental isolates to different animal reservoirs.},

Clusters of common serovars and those of human health concern were identified using a scan statistic. The period prevalence of S. enterica was 25.3\% in broiler breeders, 6.4\% in layer breeders, and 28.6\% in turkey breeders. An overall decreasing trend in S. enterica prevalence was identified in broiler breeders (from 27.8\% in 2009 to 22.1\% in 2018) and layer breeders (from 15.4\% to 4.9\%), while an increasing trend was identified in turkey breeders (from 12.0\% to 24.5\%). The most common serovars varied by commodity. Among broiler breeders, S. enterica serovars Kentucky (42.4\% of 682 submissions), Heidelberg (19.2\%), and Typhimurium (5.4\%) were the most common. Salmonella enterica serovars Thompson (20.0\% of 195 submissions) and Infantis (16.4\%) were most common among layer breeders, and S. enterica serovars Schwarzengrund (23.6\% of 1368 submissions), Senftenberg (12.9\%), and Heidelberg and Uganda (9.6\% each) were most common among turkey breeders. Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis prevalence was highest in submissions from broiler breeders (3.7\% of 682 broiler breeder submissions). Temporal clusters of S. enterica serovars were identified for all poultry commodities. Seasonal effects varied by commodity, with most peaks occurring in the fall. Our study provides information on the prevalence and temporality of S. enterica serovars within Ontario's poultry breeder flocks that might guide prevention and control programs at the breeder level.},

Digital farming aims to use available information from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges for addressing food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The digital approaches are expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making supports. Digital twin in agriculture is a virtual representation of a farm with great potential for enhancing productivity and efficiency while declining energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of digital twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural contexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation, robotics, farm machineries, and food post-harvest processing in agricultural field. Data recording, modeling including artificial intelligence, big data, simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed. Digital twin systems can support farmers as a next generation of digitalization paradigm by continuous and real-time monitoring of physical world (farm) and updating the state of virtual world.},

  abstract = {There is some evidence that neighborhood deprivation increases residents' risk of foodborne illnesses. Because urban areas with the least available access to adequate amounts of nutritious or affordable food options (or ``food deserts'') also tend to be the most deprived areas within a city, it is hypothesized that food access and foodborne illness risk are linked. However, the complexity of tracking numbers and sources of gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses often leads researchers to speculate about reasons for disproportionate rates of pathogen outbreaks among demographic groups. This study explores the suitability of existing data to examine associations between food deserts and the spatial distribution of GI illnesses in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. A spatial analysis by using GIS software methodology was used to identify and map food retail outlets and accessibility, as well as GI illness outbreaks and sales of antidiarrhea, antinausea, and rehydration products (used as a proxy for GI cases) within the city, based on available data. Statistical analysis of the maps shows no statistical relationship between location, access to food outlets, and rates of GI illness. The analysis points to shortfalls and gaps in the existing data, which leaves us unable to draw conclusions either supporting or refuting our hypothesis. This article includes recommendations to improve the current system of illness reporting and to continue to refine the definition and process of mapping food access issues. A more comprehensive set of data would enable municipalities to more easily identify groups most at risk, depending on exposures and the type of pathogen, and reduce the occurrence of foodborne disease.},

The prototype is a bottom-up system based on assumptions that incorporate expert opinion/insight with a number of exposure and hazard-related risk criteria variables, which are propagated forward with food intake data to produce risk-ranking determinations. The prototype produces a semi-quantitative comparative assessment of food safety hazards and the impacts of hazard control measures. For a specific hazard-food combination the prototype can produce a single metric: a final risk value expressed as annual pseudo-disability adjusted life years (pDALY). The pDALY is a harmonization of the very different dose-response relationships observed for chemicals and microbes. The prototype was developed on 2 platforms, a web-based user interface and an Analytica(R) model (Lumina Decision Systems, Los Gatos, Calif., U.S.A.). Comprising visual basic language, the web-based platform facilitates data input and allows use concurrently from multiple locations. The Analytica model facilitates visualization of the logic flow, interrelationship of input and output variables, and calculations/algorithms comprising the prototype. A variety of sortable risk-ranking reports and summary information can be generated for hazard-food pairs, showing hazard and dose-response assumptions and data, per capita consumption by population group, and annual p-DALY.},

The approach was adjusted to include time, space smoothing and to handle missing or misclassified information. The performance of the adjusted likelihood ratio approach on the data originating from the HUS outbreak and control data indicates that the adjusted approach is promising and indicates that the adjusted approach could be a useful tool to assist and facilitate the investigation of food borne outbreaks in the future if good traceability are available and implemented in the distribution chain.

  abstract = {Objective Traditional surveillance systems only capture a fraction of the estimated 48 million yearly cases of foodborne illness in the United States. We assessed whether foodservice reviews on Yelp.com (a business review site) can be used to support foodborne illness surveillance efforts. Methods We obtained reviews from 2005--2012 of 5824 foodservice businesses closest to 29 colleges. After extracting recent reviews describing episodes of foodborne illness, we compared implicated foods to foods in outbreak reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results Broadly, the distribution of implicated foods across five categories was as follows: aquatic (16\% Yelp, 12\% CDC), dairy-eggs (23\% Yelp, 23\% CDC), fruits-nuts (7\% Yelp, 7\% CDC), meat-poultry (32\% Yelp, 33\% CDC), and vegetables (22\% Yelp, 25\% CDC). The distribution of foods across 19 more specific food categories was also similar, with spearman correlations ranging from 0.60 to 0.85 for 2006--2011. The most implicated food categories in both Yelp and CDC were beef, dairy, grains-beans, poultry and vine-stalk. Conclusions Based on observations in this study and the increased usage of social media, we posit that online illness reports could complement traditional surveillance systems by providing near real-time information on foodborne illnesses, implicated foods and locations.},

  abstract = {Background: Traditional methods of monitoring foodborne illness are associated with problems of untimeliness and underreporting. In recent years, alternative data sources such as social media data have been used to monitor the incidence of disease in the population (infodemiology and infoveillance). These data sources prove timelier than traditional general practitioner data, they can help to fill the gaps in the reporting process, and they often include additional metadata that is useful for supplementary research. Objective: The aim of the study was to identify and formally analyze research papers using consumer-generated data, such as social media data or restaurant reviews, to quantify a disease or public health ailment. Studies of this nature are scarce within the food safety domain, therefore identification and understanding of transferrable methods in other health-related fields are of particular interest. Methods: Structured scoping methods were used to identify and analyze primary research papers using consumer-generated data for disease or public health surveillance. The title, abstract, and keyword fields of 5 databases were searched using predetermined search terms. A total of 5239 papers matched the search criteria, of which 145 were taken to full-text review---62 papers were deemed relevant and were subjected to data characterization and thematic analysis. Results: The majority of studies (40/62, 65\%) focused on the surveillance of influenza-like illness. Only 10 studies (16\%) used consumer-generated data to monitor outbreaks of foodborne illness. Twitter data (58/62, 94\%) and Yelp reviews (3/62, 5\%) were the most commonly used data sources. Studies reporting high correlations against baseline statistics used advanced statistical and computational approaches to calculate the incidence of disease. These include classification and regression approaches, clustering approaches, and lexicon-based approaches. Although they are computationally intensive due to the requirement of training data, studies using classification approaches reported the best performance. Conclusions: By analyzing studies in digital epidemiology, computer science, and public health, this paper has identified and analyzed methods of disease monitoring that can be transferred to foodborne disease surveillance. These methods fall into 4 main categories: basic approach, classification and regression, clustering approaches, and lexicon-based approaches. Although studies using a basic approach to calculate disease incidence generally report good performance against baseline measures, they are sensitive to chatter generated by media reports. More computationally advanced approaches are required to filter spurious messages and protect predictive systems against false alarms. Research using consumer-generated data for monitoring influenza-like illness is expansive; however, research regarding the use of restaurant reviews and social media data in the context of food safety is limited. Considering the advantages reported in this review, methods using consumer-generated data for foodborne disease surveillance warrant further investment.},

Methods. We used hospitalization data from Buffalo, NY, neighborhoods for a 5-year period (1996 through 2000), geographic information systems techniques, the Diggle method, and statistical analysis to compare the locations of case patients and control patients in terms of proximity to different known pollution sources in the study area. Results. We found a clustering of asthma cases in close proximity to the Peace Bridge Complex and the freeways and a dose--response relationship indicating a decreased risk of asthma prevalence the farther an individual resides from the source of exposure. Conclusions. These findings provide a basis for the development of new hypotheses relating to the spatial distribution of asthma prevalence and morbidity in this community.},

We defined the following three commodity groups from which nearly all food is derived: aquatic animals, land animals, and plants. We defined three commodities in aquatic animals, six in land animals, and eight in plants. We considered each food as a set of ingredients composed of one or more commodities. We defined a simple food as one made of ingredients that are all in one commodity and a complex food as one containing ingredients in more than one commodity. We determined likely ingredients using a panel of epidemiologists and a web-based search process. Results: We assigned 1709 (95\%) of the 1794 foods implicated in outbreaks of foodborne diseases reported to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1973 to 2006. Of those, 987 (57\%) were simple foods and 722 (43\%) were complex foods. Discussion: This categorization may serve as an input for modeling the attribution of human illness to specific food commodities and could be used by policy makers, health officials, regulatory agencies, and consumer groups to evaluate the contribution of various food commodities to illness.},

Preventing these illnesses is challenging because resources are limited and linking individual illnesses to a particular food is rarely possible except during an outbreak. We developed a method of attributing illnesses to food commodities that uses data from outbreaks associated with both simple and complex foods. Using data from outbreak-associated illnesses for 1998-2008, we estimated annual US foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths attributable to each of 17 food commodities. We attributed 46\% of illnesses to produce and found that more deaths were attributed to poultry than to any other commodity. To the extent that these estimates reflect the commodities causing all foodborne illness, they indicate that efforts are particularly needed to prevent contamination of produce and poultry. Methods to incorporate data from other sources are needed to improve attribution estimates for some commodities and agents.},

The online panel have recently gained interest as an easy and timely method to select controls. We examined the feasibility, suitability and reliability of using an online panel to select controls for case-control studies as part of investigations of diffuse food and waterborne outbreaks. In January 2019, we deployed a web survey by email to the 277 members of a non-probabilistic online panel in Lower Saxony, Germany. We questioned them on basic sociodemographic characteristics and eating habits. They were frequency matched to cases on sex and age. Their food exposures were compared to those of traditionally recruited controls of four historical case-controls studies, which successfully investigated food and waterborne outbreaks. We used logistic regressions to assess the association between the food exposures and the disease (odds ratios). The use of a control panel successfully led to the identification of the food items in three of the four historical outbreak investigations, and their recruitment benefitted from increased speed and limited costs. Timely outbreak investigations would enable rapidly implementing control measures. We recommend the further evaluation of using panellists as controls in parallel case-control studies and case-panel studies.},

We show that it is fundamentally possible to estimate the location of the source from measurements collected by sparsely placed observers. We present a strategy that is optimal for arbitrary trees, achieving maximum probability of correct localization. We describe efficient implementations with complexity O(N({$\alpha$})), where {$\alpha$}=1 for arbitrary trees and {$\alpha$}=3 for arbitrary graphs. In the context of several case studies, we determine how localization accuracy is affected by various system parameters, including the structure of the network, the density of observers, and the number of observed cascades.},

  abstract = {Reducing the burden of foodborne salmonellosis is challenging. It requires identification of the most important food sources causing disease and prioritization of effective intervention strategies. For this purpose, a variety of methods to estimate the relative contribution of different sources of Salmonella infections have been applied worldwide. Each has strengths and limitations, and the usefulness of each depends on the public health questions being addressed. In this study, we reviewed the source attribution methods and outcomes of several studies developed in different countries and settings, comparing approaches and regional differences in attribution estimates. Reviewed results suggest that illnesses and outbreaks are most commonly attributed to exposure to contaminated food, and that eggs, broiler chickens, and pigs are among the top sources. Although most source attribution studies do not attribute salmonellosis to produce, outbreak data in several countries suggest that exposure to raw vegetables is also an important source. International travel was also a consistently important exposure in several studies. Still, the relative contribution of specific sources to human salmonellosis varied substantially between studies. Although differences in data inputs, methods, and the point in the food system where attribution was estimated contribute to variability between studies, observed differences also suggest regional differences in the epidemiology of salmonellosis.},

  abstract = {In this age of data, digital tools are widely promoted as having tremendous potential for enhancing food safety. However, the potential of these digital tools depends on the availability and quality of data, and a number of obstacles need to be overcome to achieve the goal of digitally enabled "smarter food safety" approaches. One key obstacle is that participants in the food system and in food safety often lack the willingness to share data, due to fears of data abuse, bad publicity, liability, and the need to keep certain data (e.g., human illness data) confidential. As these multifaceted concerns lead to tension between data utility and privacy, the solutions to these challenges need to be multifaceted. This review outlines the data needs in digital food safety systems, exemplified in different data categories and model types, and key concerns associated with sharing of food safety data, including confidentiality and privacy of shared data. To address the data privacy issue a combination of innovative strategies to protect privacy as well as legal protection against data abuse need to be pursued. Existing solutions for maximizing data utility, while not compromising data privacy, are discussed, most notably differential privacy and federated learning.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Underreporting of foodborne illness makes foodborne disease burden estimation, timely outbreak detection, and evaluation of policies toward improving food safety challenging. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to present and evaluate Iwaspoisoned.com, an openly accessible Internet-based crowdsourcing platform that was launched in 2009 for the surveillance of foodborne illness. The goal of this system is to collect data that can be used to augment traditional approaches to foodborne disease surveillance. METHODS Individuals affected by a foodborne illness can use this system to report their symptoms and the suspected location (eg, restaurant, hotel, hospital) of infection. We present descriptive statistics of users and businesses and highlight three instances where reports of foodborne illness were submitted before the outbreaks were officially confirmed by the local departments of health. RESULTS More than 49,000 reports of suspected foodborne illness have been submitted on Iwaspoisoned.com since its inception by individuals from 89 countries and every state in the United States. Approximately 95.51\% (42,139/44,119) of complaints implicated restaurants as the source of illness. Furthermore, an estimated 67.55\% (3118/4616) of users who responded to a demographic survey were between the ages of 18 and 34, and 60.14\% (2776/4616) of the respondents were female. The platform is also currently used by health departments in 90\% (45/50) of states in the US to supplement existing programs on foodborne illness reporting. CONCLUSIONS Crowdsourced disease surveillance through systems such as Iwaspoisoned.com uses the influence and familiarity of social media to create an infrastructure for easy reporting and surveillance of suspected foodborne illness events. If combined with traditional surveillance approaches, these systems have the potential to lessen the problem of foodborne illness underreporting and aid in early detection and monitoring of foodborne disease outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Background Childhood cancer was the leading cause of death among children aged 1-14 years for 2012 in Spain. Leukemia has the highest incidence, followed by tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and lymphomas (Hodgkin lymphoma, HL, and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, NHL). Spatial distribution of childhood cancer cases has been under concern with the aim of identifying potential risk factors. Objective The two objectives are to study overall spatial clustering and cluster detection of cases of the three main childhood cancer causes, looking to increase etiological knowledge. Methods We ran a case-control study. The cases were children aged 0 to 14 diagnosed with leukemia, lymphomas (HL and NHL) or CNS neoplasm in five Spanish regions for the period 1996-2011. As a control group, we used a sample from the Birth Registry matching every case by year of birth, autonomous region of residence and sex with six controls. We geocoded and validated the address of the cases and controls. For our two objectives we used two different methodologies. For the first, for overall spatial clustering detection, we used the differences of K functions from the spatial point patterns perspective proposed by Diggle and Chetwynd and the second, for cluster detection, we used the spatial scan statistic proposed by Kulldorff with a level for statistical significance of 0.05. Results We had 1062 cases of leukemia, 714 cases of CNS, 92 of HL and 246 of NHL. Accordingly we had 6 times the number of controls, 6372 controls for leukemia, 4284 controls for CNS, 552 controls for HL and 1476 controls for NHL. We found variations in the estimated empirical D(s) for the different regions and cancers, including some overall spatial clustering for specific regions and distances. We did not find statistically significant clusters. Conclusions The variations in the estimated empirical D(s) for the different regions and cancers could be partially explained by the differences in the spatial distribution of the population; however, according to the literature, we cannot discard environmental hazards or infections agents in the etiology of these cancers.},

  abstract = {Human illness attribution has been recently recognized as an important tool to better inform food safety decisions. Analysis of outbreak data sets has been used for that purpose. This study was conducted to explore the usefulness of three comprehensive Canadian foodborne outbreak data sets covering 30 years for estimating food attribution in cases of gastrointestinal illness, providing Canadian food attribution estimates from a historical perspective. Information concerning the microbiological etiology and food vehicles recorded for each outbreak was standardized between the data sets. The agent--food vehicle combinations were described and analyzed for changes over time by using multiple correspondence analysis. Overall, 6,908 foodborne outbreaks were available for three decades (1976 through 2005), but the agent and the food vehicle were identified in only 2,107 of these outbreaks. Differences between the data sets were found in the distribution of the cause, the vehicle, and the location or size of the outbreaks. Multiple correspondence analysis revealed an association between Clostridium botulinum and wild meat and between C. botulinum and seafood. This analysis also highlighted changes in food attribution over time and generated the most up-to-date food attribution values for salmonellosis (29\% of cases associated with produce, 15\% with poultry, and 15\% with meat other than poultry, pork, and beef), campylobacteriosis (56\% of cases associated with poultry and 22\% with dairy products other than fluid milk), and Escherichia coli infection (37\% of cases associated with beef, 23\% with cooked multi-ingredient dishes, and 11\% with meat other than beef, poultry, and pork). Because of the inherent limitations of this approach, only the main findings should be considered for policy making. The use of other human illness attribution approaches may provide further clarification.},

Design: Retrospective study using matched case--control areas. Setting: Five circular regions of radius 10 km near industrial incinerators in England (case regions) and five matched control regions, 1998--2008. Participants: All cases of diseases of interest within the circular areas. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Counts of childhood cancer incidence ({$<$}15 years); childhood leukaemia incidence ({$<$}15 years); leukaemia incidence; liver cancer incidence; lung cancer incidence; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma incidence; allcause mortality; infant mortality ({$<$}1 year) and liver cancer mortality. Results: The estimated relative risks for case circles versus control circles for the nine outcomes considered range from 0.94 to 1.14, and show neither elevated risk in case circles compared to control areas nor elevated risk with proximity to incinerators within case circles. Conclusions: This study applies statistical methods for analysing spatially referenced health outcome data in regions with a hypothesised exposure relative to matched regions with no such exposure. There is no evidence of elevated risk of cancer incidence or mortality in the vicinity of large industrial incinerators in England.},

A total of 1010 telephone interviews were completed that queried the consumption of 95 food items in the 7-day period before the interview. Survey results were weighted to be representative. Six exemplary `high risk' food items were consumed by 6\% to 16\% of the general population. These were raw ground pork: 6.5\%; `Teewurst' (=spreadable sausage-containing raw pork): 15.7\%; unpasteurised milk consumed without prior heating: 9.0\%; food items prepared with raw eggs: 9.8\%; unheated sprouts or seedlings: 8.8\% and frozen berries consumed without prior heating: 6.2\%. Data from our food consumption survey were comparable to data obtained from control persons in case-control studies conducted during past foodborne disease outbreak investigations. We consider our survey an additional helpful tool that will allow comparison with food consumption data from case-patients obtained in exploratory, hypothesis-generating interviews early on in outbreak investigations, and which may assist in forming hypotheses regarding associations of illnesses with suspected food vehicles. This may facilitate and accelerate investigations of future foodborne disease outbreaks.},

This outbreak was detected using PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance, which coincided with Company X's voluntary recall of unsweetened puffed rice and wheat cereals after routine product sampling yielded Salmonella Agona. A case patient was defined as being infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Agona, with illness onset from 1 January through 1 July 2008. Case patients were interviewed using a standard questionnaire, and the proportion of ill persons who reported eating Company X puffed rice cereal was compared with Company X's market share data using binomial testing. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture inspected the cereal production facility and collected both product and environmental swab samples. Routine surveillance identified 33 case patients in 17 states. Of 32 patients interviewed, 24 (83\%) reported eating Company X puffed rice cereal. Company X puffed rice cereal represented 0.063\% of the total ready-to-eat dry cereal market share in the United States at the time of the investigation. Binomial testing suggested that the proportion of exposed case patients would not likely occur by chance (P {$<$} 0.0001). Of 17 cereal samples collected from case patient homes for laboratory testing, 2 (12\%) yielded Salmonella Agona indistinguishable from the outbreak strain. Twelve environmental swabs and nine product samples from the cereal plant yielded the outbreak strain of Salmonella Agona. Company X cereal was implicated in a similar outbreak of Salmonella Agona infection in 1998 with the same outbreak strain linked to the same production facility. We hypothesize that a recent construction project at this facility created an open wall near the cereal production area allowing reintroduction of Salmonella Agona into the product, highlighting the resilience of Salmonella in dry food production environments.},

The objective of this study is to test the efficacy of a machine-learned model of foodborne illness detection in a real-world setting. To this end, we built FINDER, a machine-learned model for real-time detection of foodborne illness using anonymous and aggregated web search and location data. We computed the fraction of people who visited a particular restaurant and later searched for terms indicative of food poisoning to identify potentially unsafe restaurants. We used this information to focus restaurant inspections in two cities and demonstrated that FINDER improves the accuracy of health inspections; restaurants identified by FINDER are 3.1 times as likely to be deemed unsafe during the inspection as restaurants identified by existing methods. Additionally, FINDER enables us to ascertain previously intractable epidemiological information, for example, in 38\% of cases the restaurant potentially causing food poisoning was not the last one visited, which may explain the lower precision of complaint-based inspections. We found that FINDER is able to reliably identify restaurants that have an active lapse in food safety, allowing for implementation of corrective actions that would prevent the potential spread of foodborne illness.},

Moreover, many studies on foodborne illnesses associated with these foods often overlook the transmission links from the initial contamination source. The prevention and control of the dissemination of foodborne pathogens should be approached holistically, involving agricultural production, processing, transport, food production, and extending to final consumption, all while adopting a One Health perspective. In this context, our objective is to compile available information on the challenges related to microbiological contamination in minimally handled fruits and vegetables. This includes major reported outbreaks, specific bacterial strains, and associated statistics throughout the production chain. We address the sources of contamination at each stage, along with issues related to food manipulation and disinfection. Additionally, we provide potential solutions to promote a healthier approach to fresh-cut fruits and vegetables.

Methods               We used the same methodology as the World Health Organization, i.e., Structured Expert Judgment according to Cooke's Classical Model, using three different panels for the three countries. Experts were interviewed remotely and completed calibration questions during the interview without access to any resources. They then completed target questions after the interview, using resources as considered necessary. Expert data were validated using two objective measures, calibration score or statistical accuracy, and information score. Performance-based weights were derived from the two measures to aggregate experts' distributions into a so-called decision maker. The analysis was made using Excalibur software, and resulting distributions were normalized using Monte Carlo simulation.                                         Results               Individual experts' uncertainty assessments resulted in modest statistical accuracy and high information scores, suggesting overconfident assessments. Nevertheless, the optimized item-weighted decision maker was statistically accurate and informative. While there is no evidence that animal pathogenic ETEC strains are infectious to humans, a sizeable proportion of ETEC illness was attributed to animal source foods as experts considered contamination of food products by infected food handlers can occur at any step in the food chain. For all pathogens, a major share of the burden was attributed to food groups of interest. Within food groups, the highest attribution was to products consumed raw, but processed products were also considered important sources of infection.                                         Conclusions               Cooke's Classical Model with performance-based weighting provided robust uncertainty estimates of the attribution of foodborne disease in three African countries.

  abstract = {Foodborne diseases remain a global public health challenge worldwide. The European surveillance system on multistate foodborne outbreaks integrates elements from public and animal health, and the food chain for the early detection, assessment, and control. This review aims to describe the significant outbreaks that occurred in Europe in the last decade. Their significance and relevance in public health laid in the changes, improvements, and novelties that derived and that pushed towards the building of a safer food system in the European Union, certainly driven by the One Health approach. In 2011, a point source monoclonal outbreak of infections caused by Escherichia coli serotype O104:H4 contaminating sprouted seeds recorded hundreds of cases of haemolytic-uremic syndrome and several fatalities. In 2015, a prolonged outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections caused by the contamination of frozen corn affected Europe with 47 cases and nine deaths. In 2016, a persistent polyclonal outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis was linked to the consumption of eggs and was associated with hundreds of cases. These outbreaks commonly highlighted the importance of sharing data (e.g. sequencing and tracing data) with rapidity and the need for harmonizing bioinformatics outputs and computational approaches to facilitate foodborne detection and investigation. Also, they led to the setting of the legal framework for the development of a European collaboration platform to share whole genome sequences data. These outbreaks enabled the enforcement of the existing hygiene and food safety provisions and led the development of new hygiene guidelines and best practises. This paper also briefly touches upon the new trends in information technologies that are being explored in the field of food traceability and safety. Their application aims to enhance the traceability of food throughout the supply chain to redirect the conventional tracing system towards a digitized supply chain.},

In modeling the entire food supply chain from farm to fork, however, these methodologies have paid little attention to consumer behavior and mobility, instead making the simplifying assumption that consumers shop in the area adjacent to their home location. This paper aims to fill this gap by introducing a gravity-based approach to model food-flows from supermarkets to consumers and demonstrating how models of consumer shopping behavior can be used to improve computational methodologies to infer the source of an outbreak of foodborne disease. To demonstrate our approach, we develop and calibrate a gravity model of German retail shopping behavior at the postal-code level. Modeling results show that on average about 70 percent of all groceries are sourced from non-home zip codes. The value of considering shopping behavior in computational approaches for inferring the source of an outbreak is illustrated through an application example to identify a retail brand source of an outbreak. We demonstrate a significant increase in the accuracy of a network-theoretic source estimator for the outbreak source when the gravity model is included in the food supply network compared with the baseline case when contaminated individuals are assumed to shop only in their home location. Our approach illustrates how gravity models can enrich computational inference models for identifying the source (retail brand, food item, location) of an outbreak of foodborne disease. More broadly, results show how gravity models can contribute to computational approaches to model consumer shopping interactions relating to retail food environments, nutrition, and public health.},

This thesis aims to fill this gap by modelling foodflows from supermarkets to consumers in a large-scale gravity model for Germany. Modelling results show that the average distance between consumers' home and supermarket is 4.65 km. Consumers in rural areas travel significantly longer distances to supermarkets compared to consumers in urban areas. On average, groceries are sourced from two to four postal zones with half of all goods originating from non-home postal zones. The results contribute to a better understanding of the last link in the food supply chain. In practice, this allows investigators to relate reported outbreak cases with sourcing zones and respective food-retailers. The inclusion of this information into existing models is expected to improve their performance.},

We model virus spreading in a network with a variant of the popular SIR model and then construct an estimator for the virus source. This estimator is based upon a novel combinatorial quantity which we term rumor centrality. We establish that this is an ML estimator for a class of graphs. We find the following surprising threshold phenomenon: on trees which grow faster than a line, the estimator always has non-trivial detection probability, whereas on trees that grow like a line, the detection probability will go to 0 as the network grows. Simulations performed on synthetic networks such as the popular small-world and scale-free networks, and on real networks such as an internet AS network and the U.S. electric power grid network, show that the estimator either finds the source exactly or within a few hops in different network topologies. We compare rumor centrality to another common network centrality notion known as distance centrality. We prove that on trees, the rumor center and distance center are equivalent, but on general networks, they may differ. Indeed, simulations show that rumor centrality outperforms distance centrality in finding virus sources in networks which are not tree-like.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of detecting the source of a rumor (information diffusion) in a network based on observations about which set of nodes possess the rumor. In a recent work [10], this question was introduced and studied. The authors proposed rumor centrality as an estimator for detecting the source. They establish it to be the maximum likelihood estimator with respect to the popular Susceptible Infected (SI) model with exponential spreading time for regular trees. They showed that as the size of infected graph increases, for a line (2-regular tree) graph, the probability of source detection goes to 0 while for d-regular trees with d {$\geq$} 3 the probability of detection, say {$\alpha$}d, remains bounded away from 0 and is less than 1/2. Their results, however stop short of providing insights for the heterogeneous setting such as irregular trees or the SI model with non-exponential spreading times. This paper overcomes this limitation and establishes the effectiveness of rumor centrality for source detection for generic random trees and the SI model with a generic spreading time distribution. The key result is an interesting connection between a multi-type continuous time branching process (an equivalent representation of a generalized Polya's urn, cf. [1]) and the effectiveness of rumor centrality. Through this, it is possible to quantify the detection probability precisely. As a consequence, we recover all the results of [10] as a special case and more importantly, we obtain a variety of results establishing the universality of rumor centrality in the context of tree-like graphs and the SI model with a generic spreading time distribution.}

Due to the complexity of ST data and the diversity of objectives, a number of ST analysis methods exist, including but not limited to clustering, prediction, and change detection. As one of the most important methods, clustering has been widely used in many applications. It is a process of grouping data with similar spatial attributes, temporal attributes, or both, from which many significant events and regular phenomena can be discovered. In this paper, some representative ST clustering methods are reviewed, most of which are extended from spatial clustering. These methods are broadly divided into hypothesis testing-based methods and partitional clustering methods that have been applied differently in previous research. Research trends and the challenges of ST clustering are also discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This analysis used data from the most recent Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) Population Survey (May 2006 through April 2007) to examine differences in the consumption of various types of foods between men and women. METHODS: Participants were surveyed by telephone and asked whether or not they had consumed certain foods in the past 7 days, including the following "high-risk" foods commonly associated with foodborne illness: pink hamburger, raw oysters, unpasteurized milk, cheese made from unpasteurized milk, runny eggs, and alfalfa sprouts. Data were weighted to adjust for survey design and to reflect the age and sex distribution of the population under FoodNet surveillance. RESULTS: A total of 14 878 persons {$\geq$} 18 years were interviewed, of whom 5688 (38\%) were men. A higher proportion of men reported eating meat and certain types of poultry than women, whereas a higher proportion of women ate fruits and vegetables. A higher proportion of men than women reported consuming runny eggs (12\% versus 8\%), pink hamburger (7\% versus 4\%), and raw oysters (2\% versus 0.4\%). A higher proportion of women than men ate alfalfa sprouts (3\% versus 2\%). No differences by sex were observed for consumption of unpasteurized milk or cheese. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the FoodNet Population Surveys can be useful in efforts to design targeted interventions regarding consumption of high-risk foods. Moreover, understanding the background rates of food consumption, stratified by sex, may help investigators identify the kinds of foods likely to be associated with outbreaks in which a preponderance of cases occur among members of one sex.},

  abstract = {Introduction During summer 2016, Norway observed an increase in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Chester cases among travellers to Greece. Aim Our aim was to investigate genetic relatedness of S. Chester for surveillance and outbreak detection by core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) and compare the results to genome mapping. Methods We included S. Chester isolates from 51 cases of salmonellosis between 2000 and 2016. Paired-end sequencing (2 {\texttimes} 250 bp) was performed on Illumina MiSeq. Genetic relatedness by cgMLST for Salmonellaenterica subsp. enterica, including 3,002 genes and seven housekeeping genes, was compared by reference genome mapping with CSI Phylogeny version 1.4 and conventional MLST. Results Confirmed travel history was available for 80\% of included cases, to Europe (n = 13), Asia (n = 12) and Africa (n = 16). Isolates were distributed into four phylogenetic clusters corresponding to geographical regions. Sequence type (ST) ST411 and a single-locus variant ST5260 (n = 17) were primarily acquired in southern Europe, ST1954 (n = 15) in Africa, ST343 (n = 11) and ST2063 (n = 8) primarily in Asia. Part of the European cluster was further divided into a Greek (n = 10) and a Cypriot (n = 4) cluster. All isolates in the African cluster displayed resistance to {$\geq$} 1 class of antimicrobials, while resistance was rare in the other clusters. Conclusion Whole genome sequencing of S. Chester in Norway showed four geographically distinct clusters, with a possible outbreak occurring during summer 2016 related to Greece. We recommend public health institutes to implement cgMLST-based real-time Salmonellaenterica surveillance for early and accurate detection of future outbreaks and further development of cluster cut-offs.},

  abstract = {Modern food systems represent complex dynamic networks vulnerable to foodborne infectious outbreaks difficult to track and control. Seasonal co-occurrences (alignment of seasonal peaks) and synchronization (similarity of seasonal patterns) of infections are noted, yet rarely explored due to their complexity and methodological limitations. We proposed a systematic approach to evaluate the co-occurrence of seasonal peaks using a combination of L-moments, seasonality characteristics such as the timing (phase) and intensity (amplitude) of peaks, and three metrics of serial, phase-phase, and phase-amplitude synchronization. We used public records on counts of nine foodborne infections abstracted from CDC's FoodNet Fast online platform for the US and ten representative states from 1996 to 2017 (264~months). Based on annualized and trend-adjusted Negative Binomial Harmonic Regression (NBHR) models augmented with the {$\delta$}-method, we determined that seasonal peaks of Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia Coli (STEC) were tightly clustered in late-July at the national and state levels. Phase-phase synchronization was observed between Cryptosporidium and Shigella, Listeria, and Salmonella ({$\rho$}\,=\,0.51, 0.51, 0.46; p\,{$<$}\,0.04). Later peak timing of STEC was associated with greater amplitude nationally ({$\rho$}\,=\,0.50, p\,=\,0.02) indicating phase-amplitude synchronization. Understanding of disease seasonal synchronization is essential for developing reliable outbreak forecasts and informing stakeholders on mitigation and preventive measures.},

  abstract = {The food supply chain is a critical part of modern societies. As with other facets of life, it is thoroughly digitalized, and uses network connections. Consequently, the cyber security of the supply chain becomes a major concern as new threats emerge. Cyber ranges can be used to prepare for such cyber security threats by creating realistic scenarios mimicking real-world systems and setups. Organizations can participate in cyber security training and exercises that present them with these scenarios. Cyber ranges can also be used efficiently for research and development activities, because cyber ranges are realistic environments and can be used for the generation of realistic data. The aim of this study is to describe a digital twin of the food supply chain built for cyber range-based cyber security exercises. The digital twin mirrors the real-world situation with sufficient detail, as required by the cyber exercise. This research uses the design science methodology, which describes the construction and evaluation of the proposed system. The study explains the general capabilities of the food supply chain digital twin and its use in the cyber range environment. Different parts of the supply chain are implemented as Node.js services that run on the Realistic Global Cyber Environment (RGCE) platform. The flow of ingredients and products is simulated using an apparatus model and message queues. The digital twin was demonstrated in a real live cyber exercise. The results indicate that the apparatus approach was a scalable and realistic enough way to implement the digital twin. The main limitations of the implemented system are the implementation on one specific platform, and the need for more feedback from multiple exercises. Creation of a digital twin enables the use of cyber ranges to train organizations related to the food supply chain.},

To inform prevention and response efforts, mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics are being increasingly applied. Here we explain how models can be developed to enhance our understanding and predictive power over population-level disease trends, by capturing both fundamental aspects of transmission and also the effects of medical and behavioral interventions. We review advances in transdisciplinary approaches of disease modeling and illustrate these advances with applications including community-based initiatives undertaken during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and age-targeting of influenza vaccination in the USA. We further discuss how modern statistical inference facilitates the incorporation of data from behavioral sciences and epidemiology into models, highlighting how data-driven models can constitute powerful tools to inform and improve public health strategies.},

  abstract = {Background Crowdsourcing is a new tool offered mainly over the internet for obtaining ideas, content, funding by seeking contributions from a large group of people and especially from the online community rather than from traditional employees or suppliers. Crowdsourcing is widespread in numerous food applications (e.g., technology, entrepreneurial projects, start-ups funding, innovative product developments). Scope and approach Although the use of crowdsourcing has increased rapidly, there is still much untapped potential in harnessing its vast innovative potential in food quality and safety solutions. This paper aims to review recent utilization of crowdsourcing practices in the food domain. Additionally, to furnish a conceptual view on possible application where crowdsourcing can be harnessed in enhancing food quality, safety and reducing risks. Key findings and conclusions It argues that crowdsourcing initiative is potentially a very useful tool as a part of the big data by utilizing the crowd's data in shelf-life monitoring, inventory control, foodborne illness surveillance, identification of contaminated products and to improve food businesses' hygiene, enhance food safety, communication and allergen management and minimizing risk. The limitations include the number of reports and data generated may overwhelm the food industry or authority due to lack of internal resources i.e. time and technical expert to process the information. There is also risk of lack of crowd participation and loss of control. Hence, a mechanism to facilitate, evaluate and process the data should be in place.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Human outbreaks of Salmonella infection have been attributed to a variety of food vehicles. Processed snack foods are increasingly consumed by children. In May 2007, state and local health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated human infections from Salmonella Wandsworth, an extremely rare serotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were used to identify outbreak-associated illnesses. Food history questionnaires and open-ended interviews were used to generate exposure hypotheses. A nationwide case-control study was conducted to epidemiologically implicate a source. Public health laboratories cultured implicated product from patient homes and retail stores. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients from 23 states were identified; 93\% were aged 10 months to 3 years. Eighty-one percent of child patients had bloody diarrhea; 6 were hospitalized. No deaths were reported. The case-control study strongly associated illness with a commercial puffed vegetable-coated ready-to-eat snack food (mOR = 23.3, P = 0.0001), leading to a nationwide recall. Parents of 92\% of interviewed case-children reported that children consumed the food during the week before their illness began; 43\% reported daily consumption. Salmonella Wandsworth, 3 additional Salmonella serotypes and Chronobacter (formerly Enterobacter) sakazaki were all cultured from this product, leading to the identification of 18 human outbreak-related Salmonella Typhimurium illnesses. CONCLUSIONS: This report documents a nationwide outbreak associated with a commercial processed ready-to-eat snack food. Cases occurred primarily in infants and toddlers, many of whom frequently consumed the food. Measures are needed to ensure that ingredients added to ready-to-eat foods after the final lethal processing step are free of pathogens.},

Analysis of spatial relationships between two phenomena is of great interest in health geography and epidemiology, especially to highlight competing interest between phenomena or evidence of a common environmental factor. Our general approach extends the Moran and Pearson indices to the bivariate case in two different sets of points. The case where the variables are Boolean is treated separately through methods using nearest neighbors distances. All tests use Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate their probability distributions, with options to distinguish spatial and no spatial correlation in the special case of identical sets analysis. Implementation in a Geographic Information System (SavGIS) and real examples are used to illustrate these spatial indices and methods in epidemiology.},

Existing studies have conducted surveys to estimate merchants' market share and factors of attractiveness to use in various proposed mathematical models. Recent trends in Big Data analysis allow us to better understand human behavior and decision making, potentially leading to location models with more realistic assumptions. In this article, we propose a novel approach for validating the Huff gravity market share model, using a large-scale transactional dataset that describes customer patronage behavior at a regional level. Although the Huff model has been well studied and widely used in the context of sales estimation, competitive facility location, and demand allocation, this article is the first in validating the Huff model with a real dataset. Our approach helps to easily apply the model in different regions and with different merchant categories. Experimental results show that the Huff model fits well when modeling customer shopping behavior for a number of shopping categories, including grocery stores, clothing stores, gas stations, and restaurants. We also conduct regression analysis to show that certain features such as gender diversity and marital status diversity lead to stronger validation of the Huff model. We believe we provide strong evidence, with the help of real-world data, that gravity-based market share models are viable assumptions for retail sales estimation and competitive facility location models.},

An emerging body of work has recognized the importance of supply chain visibility and has examined it using analytical models, behavioral methods, and case studies. Still, large-sample empirical evidence on the benefits of supply chain visibility remains elusive. We seek to bridge this gap by examining conflict minerals disclosures (mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) and financial reports to evaluate whether firms with greater visibility into their conflict minerals supply chains achieve improved operating and market performance. We use the data from conflict minerals disclosures (Form SD) to distinguish between firms that have high or low visibility into their conflict minerals sources. Then, we use event study methods to analyze differences in operating and market performance between firms with high visibility and firms with low visibility. We find that firms with high visibility into their conflict minerals supply chains achieve higher profitability than comparable firms with less visibility. In addition, we find that firms with high visibility into their conflict minerals supply chains realize improved sales performance and stock market valuations. Our results are relevant to managers because they show that firms can attain operational and market benefits by improving visibility in their supply chains.},

  abstract = {Diseases caused by the consumption of food are a significant but avoidable public health issue, and identifying the source of contamination is a key step in an outbreak investigation to prevent foodborne illnesses. Historical foodborne outbreaks provide rich data on critical attributes such as outbreak factors, food vehicles, and etiologies, and an improved understanding of the relationships between these attributes could provide insights for developing effective food safety interventions. The purpose of this study was to identify hidden patterns underlying the relations between the critical attributes involved in historical foodborne outbreaks through data mining approaches. A statistical analysis was used to identify the associations between outbreak factors and food sources, and the factors that were strongly significant were selected as predictive factors for food vehicles. A multinomial prediction model was built based on factors selected for predicting ``simple'' foods (beef, dairy, and vegetables) as sources of outbreaks. In addition, the relations between the food vehicles and common etiologies were investigated through text mining approaches (support vector machines, logistic regression, random forest, and na{\"i}ve Bayes). A support vector machine model was identified as the optimal model to predict etiologies from the occurrence of food vehicles. Association rules also indicated the specific food vehicles that have strong relations to the etiologies. Meanwhile, a food ingredient network describing the relationships between foods and ingredients was constructed and used with Monte Carlo simulation to predict possible ingredients from foods that cause an outbreak. The simulated results were confirmed with foods and ingredients that are already known to cause historical foodborne outbreaks. The method could provide insights into the prediction of the possible ingredient sources of contamination when given the name of a food. The results could provide insights into the early identification of food sources of contamination and assist in future outbreak investigations. The data-driven approach will provide a new perspective and strategies for discovering hidden knowledge from massive data.},

  abstract = {The epidemiology of foodborne disease is changing. New pathogens have emerged, and some have spread worldwide. Many, including Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, and Yersinia enterocolitica, have reservoirs in healthy food animals, from which they spread to an increasing variety of foods. These pathogens cause millions of cases of sporadic illness and chronic complications, as well as large and challenging outbreaks over many states and nations. Improved surveillance that combines rapid subtyping methods, cluster identification, and collaborative epidemiologic investigation can identify and halt large, dispersed outbreaks. Outbreak investigations and case-control studies of sporadic cases can identify sources of infection and guide the development of specific prevention strategies. Better understanding of how pathogens persist in animal reservoirs is also critical to successful long-term prevention. In the past, the central challenge of foodborne disease lay in preventing the contamination of human food with sewage or animal manure. In the future, prevention of foodborne disease will increasingly depend on controlling contamination of feed and water consumed by the animals themselves.},

Online survey population controls were comparable to cases based on age and sex. Exposure data collected through online surveys were more precise than existing control data, represented the disease-specific exposure period and could be easily modified. In one outbreak the online control exposure data differed from established population data. In both outbreaks, the information from the online population control survey supported the hypothesis of the investigation. Our findings demonstrate that online surveys were a rapid and representative way to collect responses from controls during outbreak investigations.},

Specifically, our approach uses three data mining methods, namely attribute selection, decision tree learning, and association rule discovery, to extract previously unknown and meaningful patterns that connect specific types of foodborne diseases outbreaks with associated foods vehicles and consumption locations. We use this approach to study the four most common disease causing etiologies in the Center for Disease Control (CDC) database of foodborne disease outbreaks in the year 2006, namely Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Norovirus. The analysis reveals numerous patterns of how each of these outbreaks types relates to specific foods and locations. The discovery of such patterns in foodborne disease outbreak data can be very useful is determination and implementation of suitable intervention techniques. In particular, if the associations between different food types and consumption locations are known then custom intervention techniques including specific training methods can be designed to train individuals in hygienic food handling, preparation, and consumption practices.},

For this reason, WGS is being implemented worldwide and across sectors (human, veterinary, food, and environment) for the investigation of disease outbreaks, source attribution, and improved risk characterization models. In order to extract relevant information from the large quantity~and complex data produced by WGS, a host of bioinformatics tools has been developed, allowing users to analyze and interpret sequencing data, starting from simple gene-searches to complex phylogenetic studies. Depending on the research question, the complexity of the dataset and their bioinformatics skill set, users can choose between a great variety of tools for the analysis of WGS data. In this review, we describe the relevant approaches for phylogenomic studies for outbreak studies and give an overview of selected tools for the characterization of foodborne pathogens based on WGS data. Despite the efforts of the last years, harmonization and standardization of typing tools are still urgently needed to allow for an easy comparison of data between laboratories, moving towards a one health worldwide surveillance system for foodborne pathogens.},

In Germany, salmonellosis is the second most common cause of bacterial diarrhea in humans and is associated with high hospitalization rates. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) combined with data analysis is a high throughput technology with an unprecedented discriminatory power, which is particularly well suited for targeted pathogen monitoring, rapid cluster detection and assignment of possible infection sources. However, an effective implementation of WGS methods for large-scale microbial pathogen detection and surveillance has been hampered by the lack of standardized methods, uniform quality criteria and strategies for data sharing, all of which are essential for a successful interpretation of sequencing data from different sources. To overcome these challenges, the national GenoSalmSurv project aims to establish a working model for an integrated genome-based surveillance system of {$<$}italic{$>$}Salmonella{$<$}/italic{$>$} spp. in Germany, based on a decentralized data analysis. Backbone of the model is the harmonization of laboratory procedures and sequencing protocols, the implementation of open-source bioinformatics tools for data analysis at each institution and the establishment of routine practices for cross-sectoral data sharing for a uniform result interpretation. With this model, we present a working solution for cross-sector interpretation of sequencing data from different sources (such as human, veterinarian, food, feed and environmental) and outline how a decentralized data analysis can contribute to a uniform cluster detection and facilitate outbreak investigations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The aim of the current study was to develop a method for risk ranking of chemical food safety hazards using a structured and transparent approach. The method established is semi-quantitative and uses scores on both severity and probability of the hazard. The method was applied in a case study on antibiotic residue monitoring in a variety of products in the Netherlands. Severity of the hazard was scored using the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) as well as a score on the severity of antimicrobial resistance. Probability of the hazard depended on the amount of product consumed and on the amount of antibiotics used in animals as well as evidence of residues found. Data were gathered using literature research and expert opinions. The method showed that antibiotics most relevant for monitoring were product specific. Overall, nitrofurans were amongst the most important antibiotics to be included in monitoring programs for the products studied: pork, beef, poultry, honey and shrimps. This was mainly due to the detection of residues in products imported from outside the EU. Oxytetracycline was another major important antibiotic for the products studied (both nationally produced and imported).},

All references deemed relevant, on the basis of predefined evaluation criteria, were included in the review, and the risk ranking method characterized. The methods were then clustered---based on their characteristics---into eleven method categories. These categories included: risk assessment, comparative risk assessment, risk ratio method, scoring method, cost of illness, health adjusted life years (HALY), multicriteria decision analysis, risk matrix, flow charts/decision trees, stated preference techniques and expert synthesis. Method categories were described by their characteristics, weaknesses and strengths, data resources, and fields of applications. It was concluded there is no single best method for risk ranking. The method to be used should be selected on the basis of risk manager/assessor requirements, data availability, and the characteristics of the method.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Listeria monocytogenes has been estimated to cause {$>$}2500 illnesses and 500 deaths annually in the United States. Efforts to reduce foodborne listeriosis have focused on foods frequently implicated in outbreaks. Potential sources for L. monocytogenes infection not associated with outbreaks remain poorly understood. METHODS: The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network conducts surveillance for culture-confirmed listeriosis at clinical laboratories in 9 states. After excluding outbreak-associated cases, we attempted to enroll eligible case patients with L. monocytogenes infection in a case-control study from 2000 through 2003. Control subjects were recruited through health care providers and were matched to case patients by state, age, and immunosuppression status. Data were collected about exposures occurring in the 4 weeks before specimen collection from the case patients. RESULTS: Of the 249 case patients with L. monocytogenes infection, only 12 (5\%) had cases that were associated with outbreaks; 6 other patients were ineligible for other reasons. Of 231 eligible case patients, 169 (73\%) were enrolled in the study. We classified 28 case patients as having pregnancy-associated cases. We enrolled 376 control subjects. In multivariable analysis, L. monocytogenes infection was associated with eating melons at a commercial establishment (odds ratio, 2.6; 95\% confidence interval, 1.4-5.0) and eating hummus prepared in a commercial establishment (odds ratio, 5.7; 95\% confidence interval, 1.7-19.1). CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of L. monocytogenes infection were not associated with outbreaks. Reducing the burden of foodborne listeriosis may require interventions directed at retail environments and at foods, such as melons and hummus, that are not commonly recognized as high risk. Because of the severity of listeriosis, pregnant women and other persons at risk may wish to avoid eating these newly implicated foods.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) and its sub-discipline machine learning (ML) are re-emerging and gaining an ever increasing popularity in the scientific community and industry, and could lead to actionable knowledge in diverse ranges of sectors including epidemiological investigations of FBD outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). As genotyping using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming more accessible and affordable, it is increasingly used as a routine tool for the detection of pathogens, and has the potential to differentiate between outbreak strains that are closely related, identify virulence/resistance genes and provide improved understanding of transmission events within hours to days. In most cases, the computational pipeline of WGS data analysis can be divided into four (though, not necessarily consecutive) major steps: de novo genome assembly, genome characterization, comparative genomics, and inference of phylogeny or phylogenomics. In each step, ML could be used to increase the speed and potentially the accuracy (provided increasing amounts of high-quality input data) of identification of the source of ongoing outbreaks, leading to more efficient treatment and prevention of additional cases. In this review, we explore whether ML or any other form of AI algorithms have already been proposed for the respective tasks and compare those with mechanistic model-based approaches.},

The animal reservoirs of these Campylobacter species, and the sources and routes of transmission, are described and discussed in this chapter. Most warm-blooded animals can be colonized by Campylobacter, but avian species, and in particular poultry, are preferred hosts. Much of the world's poultry production is colonized by Campylobacter. Source attribution studies estimate that 20--40\% of cases are attributed to the handling and consumption of chicken meat, while up to 80\% of cases are due to Campylobacter found in the chicken reservoir. The difference suggests that routes other than through the food chain, i.e., environmental contamination, are important. The epidemiology of infections in humans differs between industrialized and low- and middle-income countries. Thus, the most effective interventions would be targeted to primary production. To date, only improved biosecurity is available. If effectively implemented, strict biosecurity can reduce the number of Campylobacter-positive flocks, but implementation to this level has proved difficult for the poultry industry. Available interventions in chicken processing plants can substantially reduce Campylobacter numbers on carcasses and consequently reduce the risk to humans. Public health strategies therefore utilize control programs, which aim at reducing the level of Campylobacter by measures along the food chain. It is now recognized that commercially acceptable complementary interventions for primary production, such as vaccines and feed additives, are urgently needed. Once Campylobacter in poultry is controlled then other minor sources of Campylobacter including contaminated drinking water, direct contact with (pet) animals, and other food items (e.g., red meat and milk) can be addressed.},

We propose network analysis models as an accurate, high-resolution source attribution approach for the sources of human campylobacteriosis. A weighted network analysis approach was used in this study for source attribution comparing different WGS data inputs. The compared model inputs consisted of cgMLST and wgMLST distance matrices from 717 human and 717 animal isolates from cattle, chickens, dogs, ducks, pigs and turkeys. SNP distance matrices from 720 human and 720 animal isolates were also used. The data were collected from 2015 to 2017 in Denmark, with the animal sources consisting of domestic and imports from 7 European countries. Clusters consisted of network nodes representing respective genomes and links representing distances between genomes. Based on the results, animal sources were the main driving factor for cluster formation, followed by type of species and sampling year. The coherence source clustering (CSC) values based on animal sources were 78\%, 81\% and 78\% for cgMLST, wgMLST and SNP, respectively. The CSC values based on Campylobacter species were 78\%, 79\% and 69\% for cgMLST, wgMLST and SNP, respectively. Including human isolates in the network resulted in 88\%, 77\% and 88\% of the total human isolates being clustered with the different animal sources for cgMLST, wgMLST and SNP, respectively. Between 12\% and 23\% of human isolates were not attributed to any animal source. Most of the human genomes were attributed to chickens from Denmark, with an average attribution percentage of 52.8\%, 52.2\% and 51.2\% for cgMLST, wgMLST and SNP distance matrices respectively, while ducks from Denmark showed the least attribution of 0\% for all three distance matrices. The best-performing model was the one using wgMLST distance matrix as input data, which had a CSC value of 81\%. Results from our study show that the weighted network-based approach for source attribution is reliable and can be used as an alternative method for source attribution considering the high performance of the model. The model is also robust across the different Campylobacter species, animal sources and WGS data types used as input.},

  abstract = {Recently there has been increased interest, from both the media and the public, in the question, "Is there an excess of disease risk close to a prespecified point source?" To address this question, routinely available public health data may be analyzed. In the United Kingdom, as in many countries, health data and the associated population data that are required for comparison, are available as aggregated counts. In this article we propose to analyze such data using a Bayesian disease mapping framework. This framework allows the extra-Poisson variability that is frequently encountered to be accommodated through random effects that may be unstructured or display spatial dependence. The disease risk-spatial location relationship is modeled using a simple but realistic parametric form. The random effects may be used for diagnostic purposes, in particular to assess the appropriateness of the distance-risk model. The choice of prior distribution is extremely important in this context and we develop an informative prior distribution that is based on epidemiological considerations and on additional analyses of data that are obtained from a larger "reference" region within which the study region is embedded. We argue that a particularly useful inferential summary for public health purposes is the predictive distribution. For example, we may obtain the distribution of the number of cases that would be expected to occur within a specified distance of the putative source (given a population size, by age and sex, and a time period). The approach is illustrated using data from an investigation into the incidence of stomach cancer close to a municipal solid waste incinerator. The sensitivity to the prior distribution and the presence or absence of spatial random effects is examined. To determine whether the increase in risk detected in the study is persistent, we analyze incidence data from the four-year interval following the study period. We finally describe a number of extensions including the modeling of data from a number of sites using a four-stage hierarchical model. This model is statistically realistic and, more importantly, allows the epidemiological question to be answered with greater reliability.},

We introduce a new method for picking prior distributions, and propose a number of refinements of previously used models. We also consider ecological bias, mutual standardization, and choice of both spatial model and prior specification. We analyze male lip cancer incidence data collected in Scotland over the period 1975--1980, and outline a number of problems with previous analyses of these data. In disease mapping studies, hierarchical models can provide robust estimation of area-level risk parameters, though care is required in the choice of covariate model, and it is important to assess the sensitivity of estimates to the spatial model chosen, and to the prior specifications on the variance parameters. Spatial ecological regression is a far more hazardous enterprise for two reasons. First, there is always the possibility of ecological bias, and this can only be alleviated by the inclusion of individual-level data. For the Scottish data, we show that the previously used mean model has limited interpretation from an individual perspective. Second, when residual spatial dependence is modeled, and if the exposure has spatial structure, then estimates of exposure association parameters will change when compared with those obtained from the independence across space model, and the data alone cannot choose the form and extent of spatial correlation that is appropriate.},

  abstract = {Recent outbreaks of illnesses traced to contaminated sprouts and lettuce illustrate the holes that exist in the system for monitoring problems and preventing foodborne diseases. Although it is not solely responsible for ensuring the safety of the nation's food supply, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees monitoring and intervention for 80 percent of the food supply. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's abilities to discover potential threats to food safety and prevent outbreaks of foodborne illness are hampered by impediments to efficient use of its limited resources and a piecemeal approach to gathering and using information on risks. Enhancing Food Safety: The Role of the Food and Drug Administration, a new book from the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council, responds to a congressional request for recommendations on how to close gaps in FDA's food safety systems. Enhancing Food Safety begins with a brief review of the Food Protection Plan (FPP), FDA's food safety philosophy developed in 2007. The lack of sufficient detail and specific strategies in the FPP renders it ineffectual. The book stresses the need for FPP to evolve and be supported by the type of strategic planning described in these pages. It also explores the development and implementation of a stronger, more effective food safety system built on a risk-based approach to food safety management. Conclusions and recommendations include adopting a risk-based decision-making approach to food safety; creating a data surveillance and research infrastructure; integrating federal, state, and local government food safety programs; enhancing efficiency of inspections; and more. Although food safety is the responsibility of everyone, from producers to consumers, the FDA and other regulatory agencies have an essential role. In many instances, the FDA must carry out this responsibility against a backdrop of multiple stakeholder interests, inadequate resources, and competing priorities. Of interest to the food production industry, consumer advocacy groups, health care professionals, and others, Enhancing Food Safety provides the FDA and Congress with a course of action that will enable the agency to become more efficient and effective in carrying out its food safety mission in a rapidly changing world.},

For tree networks, multiple sequential observations for one single instance of rumor spreading cannot improve over the initial snapshot observation. The situation dramatically improves for multiple independent observations. We propose a unified inference framework based on the union rumor centrality, and provide explicit detection performance for degree-regular tree networks. Surprisingly, even with merely two observations, the detection probability at least doubles that of a single observation, and further approaches one, i.e., reliable detection, with increasing degree. This indicates that a richer diversity enhances detectability. For general graphs, a detection algorithm using a breadth-first search strategy is also proposed and evaluated. Besides rumor source detection, our results can be used in network forensics to combat recurring epidemic-like information spreading such as online anomaly and fraudulent email spams.},

Few of them gives a comprehensive analysis in modeling the propagation of worms which is helpful for developing defense mechanism against worms' spreading. This paper presents a survey and comparison of worms' propagation models according to two different spreading methods of worms. We first identify worms characteristics through their spreading behavior, and then classify various target discover techniques employed by them. Furthermore, we investigate different topologies for modeling the spreading of worms, analyze various worms' propagation models and emphasize the performance of each model.

  abstract = {Background: Foodborne diseases, as a type of disease with a high global incidence, place a heavy burden on public health and social economy. Foodborne pathogens, as the main factor of foodborne diseases, play an important role in the treatment and prevention of foodborne diseases; however, foodborne diseases caused by different pathogens lack specificity in clinical features, and there is a low proportion of clinically actual pathogen detection in real life. Objective: We aimed to analyze foodborne disease case data, select appropriate features based on analysis results, and use machine learning methods to classify foodborne disease pathogens to predict foodborne disease pathogens that have not been tested. Methods: We extracted features such as space, time, and exposed food from foodborne disease case data and analyzed the relationship between these features and the foodborne disease pathogens using a variety of machine learning methods to classify foodborne disease pathogens. We compared the results of 4 models to obtain the pathogen prediction model with the highest accuracy. Results: The gradient boost decision tree model obtained the highest accuracy, with accuracy approaching 69\% in identifying 4 pathogens including Salmonella, Norovirus, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. By evaluating the importance of features such as time of illness, geographical longitude and latitude, and diarrhea frequency, we found that they play important roles in classifying the foodborne disease pathogens. Conclusions: Data analysis can reflect the distribution of some features of foodborne diseases and the relationship among the features. The classification of pathogens based on the analysis results and machine learning methods can provide beneficial support for clinical auxiliary diagnosis and treatment of foodborne diseases.},

  abstract = {Bacillus cereus is a food-borne pathogen that can produce cereulide in the growth period, which causes food poisoning symptoms. Due to its resistance to heat, extreme pH, and proteolytic enzymes, cereulide poses a serious threat to food safety. Temperature, pH, and aw can influence cereulide production, but there is still a lack of research with multi-environmental impacts. In this study, the effects of temperature (15{\textasciitilde}45 {\textopenbullet}C), pH (5{\textasciitilde}8), and aw (0.945{\textasciitilde}0.996) on the emetic reference strain B. cereus F4810/72 growth, cereulide production, relevant ces genes (cesA, cesB, cesP), and transcription regulators genes (codY and abrB) expression at transcription level were studied. B. cereus survived for 4{\textasciitilde}53 h or grew to 6.85{\textasciitilde}8.15 log10 CFU/mL in environmental combinations. Cereulide accumulation was higher in mid-temperature, acidic, or high aw environments. Increased temperature resulted in a lower cereulide concentration at pH 8 or aw of 0.970. The lowest cereulide concentration was found at pH 6.5 with an increased aw from 0.970 to 0.996. Water activity had a strong effect on transcriptional regulator genes as well as the cesB gene, and temperature was the main effect factor of cesP gene expression. Moreover, environmental factors also impact cereulide synthesis at transcriptional levels thereby altering the cereulide concentrations. The interaction of environmental factors may result in the survival of B. cereus without growth for a period. Gene expression is affected by environmental factors, and temperature and pH may be the main factors influencing the correlation between B. cereus growth and cereulide formation. This study contributed to an initial understanding of the intrinsic link between the impact of environmental factors and cereulide formation and provided valuable information for clarifying the mechanism of cereulide synthesis in combined environmental conditions.},

An advantage of the design, compared to traditional case-control studies, is that risk ratios can easily be obtained directly from the cross-product of exposed and unexposed cases and controls (rare disease assumption is not required). We illustrate this in the context of point source gastrointestinal outbreaks and in field studies on vaccine effectiveness. The design is also useful to investigate multiple outcomes with a unique sample of controls or to test hypotheses when different case-definitions (from the most sensitive to the most specific) are used for a particular outcome.

Food commodities consumed at locations identified as most probable site of infection (outbreak clusters) were traced back in order to identify connections between different disease clusters via the supply chain of the foods. A newly developed relational database with integrated consistency and plausibility checks was used to collate these data for further analysis. Connections between suppliers, distributors, and producers were visualized in network graphs and geographic projections. Finally, this trace-back and trace-forward analysis led to the identification of sprouts produced by a horticultural farm in Lower Saxony as vehicle for the pathogen, and a specific lot of fenugreek seeds imported from Egypt as the most likely source of contamination. Network graphs have proven to be a powerful tool for summarizing and communicating complex trade relationships to various stake holders. The present article gives a detailed description of the newly developed tracing tools and recommendations for necessary requirements and improvements for future foodborne outbreak investigations.},

The software allows integrated data management, data linkage, enrichment and visualization as well as interactive supply chain analyses. Identification of possible outbreak sources or vehicles is facilitated by calculation of tracing scores for food-handling stations (companies or persons) and food products under investigation. The software also supports consideration of station-specific cross-contamination, analysis of geographical relationships, and topological clustering of the tracing network structure. FoodChain-Lab has been applied successfully in previous outbreak investigations, for example during the 2011 EHEC outbreak and the 2013/14 European hepatitis A outbreak. The software is most useful in complex, multi-area outbreak investigations where epidemiological evidence may be insufficient to discriminate between multiple implicated food products. The automated analysis and visualization components would be of greater value if trading information on food ingredients and compound products was more easily available.},

  abstract = {Foodborne outbreak investigations have traditionally included the detection of a cluster of illnesses first, followed by an epidemiologic investigation to identify a food of interest. The increasing use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) subtyping technology for clinical, environmental, and food isolates of foodborne pathogens, and the ability to share and compare the data on public platforms, present new opportunities to identify earlier links between illnesses and their potential sources. We describe a process called sample-initiated retrospective outbreak investigations (SIROIs) used by federal public health and regulatory partners in the United States. SIROIs begin with an evaluation of the genomic similarity between bacterial isolates recovered from food or environmental samples and clusters of clinical isolates while subsequent and parallel epidemiologic and traceback investigations are initiated to corroborate their connection. SIROIs allow for earlier hypothesis generation, followed by targeted collection of information about food exposures and the foods and manufacturer of interest, to confirm a link between the illnesses and their source. This often leads to earlier action that could reduce the breadth and burden of foodborne illness outbreaks. We describe two case studies of recent SIROIs and present the benefits and challenges. Benefits include insight into foodborne illness attribution, international collaboration, and opportunities for enhanced food safety efforts in the food industry. Challenges include resource intensiveness, variability of epidemiologic and traceback data, and an increasingly complex food supply chain. SIROIs are valuable in identifying connections among small numbers of illnesses that may span significant time periods; detecting early signals for larger outbreaks or food safety issues associated with manufacturers; improving our understanding of the scope of contamination of foods; and identifying novel pathogen/commodity pairs.},

In Germany, and probably also in other countries of the European Union, this seems to be particularly true for those investigated by local health authorities. Analytical studies, usually cohort studies or case-control studies, are a powerful tool to identify suspect food vehicles. Therefore, from a public health and food safety perspective, their more frequent usage is highly desirable.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foodborne illness is a continuing public health problem in the United States. Although outbreak-associated illnesses represent a fraction of all foodborne illnesses, foodborne outbreak investigations provide critical information on the pathogens, foods, and food-pathogen pairs causing illness. Therefore, identification of a food source in an outbreak investigation is key to impacting food safety. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically identify outbreak-associated case demographic and outbreak characteristics that are predictive of food sources using Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) outbreaks reported to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1998 to 2014 with a single ingredient identified. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differences between STEC food sources by all candidate predictors were assessed univariately. Multinomial logistic regression was used to build a prediction model, which was internally validated using a split-sample approach. RESULTS: There were 206 single-ingredient STEC outbreaks reported to CDC, including 125 (61\%) beef outbreaks, 30 (14\%) dairy outbreaks, and 51 (25\%) vegetable outbreaks. The model differentiated food sources, with an overall sensitivity of 80\% in the derivation set and 61\% in the validation set. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility for a tool for public health professionals to rule out food sources during hypothesis generation in foodborne outbreak investigation and to improve efficiency while complementing existing methods.},

The pathogens that contaminate food have many diverse reservoirs, resulting in seemingly limitless potential vehicles. Identifying a vehicle is particularly challenging for clusters detected through national pathogen-specific surveillance, because cases can be geographically dispersed and lack an obvious epidemiologic link. Moreover, state and local health departments could have limited resources to dedicate to cluster and outbreak investigations. These challenges underscore the importance of hypothesis generation during an outbreak investigation. In this review, we present a framework for hypothesis generation focusing on 3 primary sources of information, typically used in combination: 1) known sources of the pathogen causing illness; 2) person, place, and time characteristics of cases associated with the outbreak (descriptive data); and 3) case exposure assessment. Hypothesis generation can narrow the list of potential food vehicles and focus subsequent epidemiologic, laboratory, environmental, and traceback efforts, ensuring that time and resources are used more efficiently and increasing the likelihood of rapidly and conclusively implicating the contaminated food vehicle.},

Historical outbreak data are an important source of information for hypothesis generation, providing data on common food- and animal-pathogen pairs and other epidemiological trends. We developed a model to predict vehicles for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and Salmonella outbreaks using demographic and outbreak characteristics from outbreaks in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (1998-2019) and Animal Contact Outbreak Surveillance System (2009-2019). We evaluated six algorithmic methods for prediction based on their ability to predict multiple class probabilities, selecting the random forest prediction model, which performed best with the lowest Brier score (0.0953) and highest accuracy (0.54). The model performed best for outbreaks transmitted by animal contact and foodborne outbreaks associated with eggs, meat, or vegetables. Expanding the criteria to include the two highest predicted vehicles, 83\% of egg outbreaks were predicted correctly, followed by meat (82\%), vegetables (74\%), poultry (67\%), and animal contact (62\%). The model performed less well for fruit and poultry vehicles, and it did not predict any dairy outbreaks. The final model was translated into a free, publicly available online tool that can be used by investigators to provide data-driven hypotheses about outbreak vehicles as part of ongoing outbreak investigations. Investigators should use the tool for hypothesis generation along-side other sources, such as food-pathogen pairs, descriptive data, and case exposure assessments. The tool should be implemented in the context of individual outbreaks and with an awareness of its limitations, including the heterogeneity of outbreaks and the possibility of novel food vehicles.},

The Integrated Food Safety Centers of Excellence identify and implement best practices and serve as resources for public health professionals who investigate enteric disease outbreaks. To target the needs of this diverse workforce, the Integrated Food Safety Centers of Excellence developed and assessed a professional tier framework and competencies. METHODS: We described the characteristics of public health professionals who investigate enteric disease outbreaks in the epidemiology role in a conceptual tiered framework. We mapped core competencies to each tier and disseminated a survey to practitioners at local (June 2019) and state (August 2018) US public health agencies to evaluate the importance and frequency of each competency. RESULTS: We developed 15 competencies on surveillance, outbreak detection, interview skills, investigation team, specimen testing, data analysis, hypothesis generation, study design, communication, enteric disease biology, control measures, legal authority, quality improvement, environmental health, and reporting to surveillance. The 286 survey respondents selected interview skills, surveillance, control measures, and hypothesis generation as the competencies most important to their work and most frequently performed. CONCLUSION: The Integrated Food Safety Centers of Excellence created the first published workforce framework and competencies for public health professionals who detect and investigate enteric disease outbreaks in the epidemiology role, in collaboration with local, state, and federal public health agencies and national organizations. These tools have been integrated into existing programs and can be used to develop training curricula, assess workforce competency over time, and identify priorities for continuing education and training.},

  abstract = {Makassar city experiences many residential fire disasters during the last years. One of the causes of fires is difficult to overcome due to the firefighters' late response. The number of fires occurred due to the ineffectiveness of the fire fighting road, obstructed by traffic conditions, in its operation. Developing a geospatial route analysis can help firefighters quickly find the best route to a fire point to overcome this problem. Geospatial route analysis is currently a key role in emergency responses for urban fire disasters. A routing system can provide network analysis that allows users to navigate between source and destination points. In this case, the system can help firefighters to arrive as quickly as possible. On complicated road networks, some impedance factors would slow down drivers on a particular road. This study aims to provide firefighters from the base stations to residential fire disaster locations. The method used in the studies is Dijkstra's algorithms to calculate weights of the impedance factors to optimal routing based on length of the road, speed drive, and traffic conditions. Implementation of routing analysis using open source geospatial software, PostgreSQL as database management system with PostGIS, and pgrouting as extensions. The modeling results show that the optimal route selection with speed parameters based on road classification has a low weight value. Therefore, it can be used as a reference for selecting a firefighter's routing.},

Methods We explored the advantages and disadvantages of comparing risk factors for enteric diseases using the case-case method. The main issues are illustrated with an analysis of routine notification data on enteric diseases for 2006 collected by New Zealand's national surveillance system. Results Our analyses of aggregated New Zealand surveillance data found that the associations (crude odds ratios) for risk factors of enteric disease were fairly consistent with findings from local case-control studies and outbreak investigations, adding support for the use of the case-case analytical approach. Despite various inherent limitations, such an approach has the potential to contribute to the monitoring of risk factor trends for enteric diseases. Nevertheless, using the case-case method for analysis of routine surveillance data may need to be accompanied by: (i) reduction of potential selection and information biases by improving the quality of the surveillance data; and (ii) reduction of confounding by conducting more sophisticated analyses based on individual-level data. Conclusion Case-case analyses of enteric diseases using routine surveillance data might be a useful low-cost means to study trends in enteric disease sources and inform control measures. If used, it should probably supplement rather than replace outbreak investigations and case-control studies. Furthermore, it could be enhanced by utilising high quality individual-level data provided by nationally-representative sentinel sites for enteric disease surveillance.},

  abstract = {In most fast-urbanising cities there is an enormous challenge in the provision of decent housing for the urban poor. It is common for the housing for the urban poor to be sited in areas of poor transport and job accessibility. This paper hypothesizes that for those cities that have reasonable growth potentials, the priority for such housing provision should be a much greater effort in coordinating the distribution of jobs and transport infrastructure construction with housing. To examine this hypothesis, we establish a systematic and quantitative approach to evaluate the long-term impacts of alternative urban development strategies by extending a recursive spatial equilibrium model through differentiating socio-economic groups based on the Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero schema. The model is tested using empirical data from Beijing, a city where the imbalance among housing, jobs and transport has become an acute issue. The model results show that the current required level of effort in the coordination is likely to be a magnitude higher than what the current policies envisage. Further decentralisation of employment coordinated with improved transport interventions and enhanced housing supply in new towns is critical in resolving the problems of increased commuting demands and low job accessibility. The Polar Silk Road (PSR) opens up China's maritime trade route through the Arctic to Northwest Europe and influences the cargo transport pattern of China's coastal ports, resulting in changes in the freight spatial pattern of port system. This study uses Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis to predict and analyse the evolution of freight spatial pattern of China's coastal ports facing the PSR. Oil, liquefied natural gas, iron ore, coal, timber and container are selected as important cargos to be studied. Results show that the northern ports have higher attraction potential than the southern ports. All cargos facing the PSR show significant spatial agglomeration characteristics. The local spatial patterns of northern ports tend to change towards high values, whereas the southern ports are the opposite. The Bohai Rim and Yangtze River Delta have a certain hierarchical structure for the PSR. The gravity centre of China's coastal port system is in the northern area facing the PSR, where the comprehensive cargo convergence capacity of large ports in the Bohai Rim is stronger than that in other regions. The role orientation and development prospects of different port freight spaces are classified. In tourism studies, new means of data collection (e.g., smartphone and Internet) have opened up new opportunities for unveiling spatial patterns at various scales. This paper aims to analyze the discrepancy between actual and expected flows between scenic spots in an urban destination at different distance ranges, on an urban scale, based on the individual travel tips data extracted from online sources. The results based on Nanjing, China, indicate that scenic spots with a high degree of centrality are more important in the network of expected flow compared to actual flow. Actual and expected flows of scenic spots are the consequence of the interaction among various factors, including inflow degree, outflow flow, and distance. Moreover, these flows are distance-sensitive at a low level, with a higher sensitivity of the actual flow. Because of the actual situation during the travel, tourists may adjust the itinerary from the expected flow and avoid the trip between two distant scenic spots due to various constraints. Lastly, implications are provided for destination planning and marketing. With the rapid increase in the availability of passive data in the field of transportation, combining machine learning with transportation models has emerged as an important research topic in recent years. This study proposes an entropy Tucker model that integrates (1) a Tucker decomposition technique, i.e., an existing machine learning method, and (2) an entropy maximizing model, i.e., an existing model used for modeling trip distribution in the field of transportation. In addition, an optimization algorithm is presented to empirically identify the proposed model. The proposed model provides a solid theoretical foundation for the machine learning method, substantially improves prediction performance, and provides richer behavioral implications through empirical parameter estimation of travel impedance. We conducted a case study using public transit smart card data. The results showed that the proposed model improves the prediction performance and interpretability of the results compared to the conventional nonnegative Tucker decomposition technique. Further, we empirically confirmed that the travel impedance varies with the origin--destination pair, time of the day, and day of the week. Finally, we discussed how embedding the theoretical foundations of transport modeling into machine learning methods can facilitate the use of various passive data in wider practical contexts of transport policy decision making.},

By combining the two observers based similarity measures with relaxed DIS, we propose a novel source locating method. Assuming that the diffusion process on complex networks follows discrete Susceptible-Infectious (SI) model, we verify the performance of this method on a series of synthetic and real networks.

Identification of diffusion source is crucial for developing strategies to control these harmful diffusion processes. At present, accurately identifying the diffusion source is still an opening challenge. In this paper, we define a kind of diffusion characteristics that is composed of the diffusion direction and time information of observers, and propose a neural networks based diffusion characteristics classification framework (NN-DCCF) to identify the source. The NN-DCCF contains three stages. First, the diffusion characteristics are utilized to construct network snapshot feature. Then, a graph LSTM auto-encoder is proposed to convert the network snapshot feature into low-dimension representation vectors. Further, a source classification neural network is proposed to identify the diffusion source by classifying the representation vectors. With NN-DCCF, the identification of diffusion source is converted into a classification problem. Experiments are performed on a series of synthetic and real networks. The results show that the NN-DCCF is feasible and effective in accurately identifying the diffusion source.},

We introduce a relaxed direction-induced search (DIS) to utilize the diffusion direction information of the observers to approximate the actual diffusion tree on a network.

After modifying the formula for the effective spread rate, we obtain the theoretical result that the coexistence of partial immunization and immune failure does not affect the network spread threshold. At the same time, the experimental results show that the existence of the above two conditions greatly increases the spread of the virus and extends the diffusion range. The study also found that in the scale-free network, peak viral infection occurs at the beginning of the spreading process, and after the immunization strategy is applied, the early infection peak is effectively curbed.},

Relatively steady rates of sequence divergence in livestock lineages enabled the inference of their recent origins. Elevated accumulation of lineage-specific pseudogenes after divergence from generalist populations and possible metabolic acclimation in a representative swine isolate indicates possible emergence of host adaptation. We developed and retrospectively applied a machine learning Random Forest classifier for genomic source prediction of Salmonella Typhimurium that correctly attributed 7 of 8 major zoonotic outbreaks in the United States during 1998-2013. We further identified 50 key genetic features that were sufficient for robust livestock source prediction.},

To optimize design of EM programs, we developed EnABLe ("Environmental monitoring with an Agent-Based Model of Listeria"), a detailed and customizable agent-based simulation of a built environment. EnABLe is presented here in a model system, tracing Listeria spp. (LS) (an indicator for conditions that allow the presence of the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes) on equipment and environment surfaces in a cold-smoked salmon facility. EnABLe was parameterized by existing literature and expert elicitation and validated with historical data. Simulations revealed different contamination dynamics and risks among equipment surfaces in terms of the presence, level and persistence of LS. Grouping of surfaces by their LS contamination dynamics identified connectivity and sanitary design as predictors of contamination, indicating that these features should be considered in the design of EM programs to detect LS. The EnABLe modeling approach is particularly timely for the frozen food industry, seeking science-based recommendations for EM, and may also be relevant to other complex environments where pathogen contamination presents risks for direct or indirect human exposure.},
