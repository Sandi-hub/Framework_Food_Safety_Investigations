- [[@doerr.etal2012]] developed the likelihood-based method to identify wholesalers involved in distributing contaminated food given the contaminated food type, its [[Food Supply Network]] and a set of case reports
- [[@kaufman.etal2014]] applied this model to real [[Retail Sales Data]] in Germany to pinpoint contaminated products, not wholesalers. 
- @norstrom.etal2015 refined this approach by considering time, consumer mobility, and noise and apply it to the 2006 Norwegian [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] outbreak. 
	- Focused on identifying specific products down to the brand, batch, and lot, using detailed product data
	- Relied on more granular data (lots, batches, expiry dates) and questionnaire responses compared to previous studies 
- @hu.etal2016 operationalize this model within a comprehensive framework that included a 
	- food distribution model
	- outbreak generator
	- statistical analytics component
		- introduces several new metrics for the model that improve the monitoring of the performance and enables comparison of models and methodologies. 
	- splitting the system into three parts allows to upload new datasets easily and improves the exchangeability of single components.
- @hu.etal2016a demonstrate the utility of the developed framework in 2 experimental setups
	- first setup similar to the intention of [[@doerr.etal2012]]
		- real census data from Berlin
		- real grocery store locations
		- modeled assignment of distributors to retail stores (scale-free network simulation)
		- modeled shopping probability (Huff's gravity model)
	- second setup according to [[@kaufman.etal2014]], incorporating new metrics
