Exposure data captured from interviews of sporadic, non-outbreak cases of reportable conditions, including [[Salmonella]], [[Escherichia coli|STEC]] and [[Listeria]] monocytogenes @jervis.etal2019 or standardized data collected in previous outbreaks [[@white.etal2021]]
- “Listeria Initiative and Project Hg” [[@white.etal2021]], p. 2195: @centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdc2023

# @jervis.etal2019, p. 1413
can be used as a background exposure in a [[Binomial Trial]] design

**Advantages and Limitations**
- [p] they are likely to reflect general exposure risks for the pathogen, absent clustering for the specific exposures responsible for the outbreak 
- [p] By virtue of being reported to a health department, these cases have similar health-seeking behavior as the outbreak cases
- [c] data are not weighted to be representative of the U.S. population as in the FoodNet Population Survey

# @mccollum.etal2013
use data from the @centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdc2023 Listeria Initiative in a [[Case-Case Studies|case-case study]] design to test their hypothesis of cantaloupe exposure as outbreak source
