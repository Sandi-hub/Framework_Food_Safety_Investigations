> For a microorganism to establish within a food environment, it must be able to acquire the necessary nutrient needed for energy production and cellular biosynthesis. 

@demirci.etal2020, Chapter 1.1 & 1.2

For the growth and maintenance of metabolic processes within a food matrix, microorganisms necessitate various types and amounts of nutrients, with the specific needs varying depending on the microorganism; however, all microorganisms are unified in their requirement to absorb these nutrients from their immediate environment.
## 1. Water
- not necessarily considered a nutrient: but is needed as a transport medium for metabolic reactions which aid in the synthesis of cell biomass and energy 
  (Ray and Bhunia, 2008)

## 2. Nutritional requirements
Amounts of nutrients depends on the type of food product (Ray and Bhunia, 2008)
- **meat products**: sufficient amounts of proteins, lipids, vitamins and minerals but levels of carbohydrates are limited
- **plant products**: high quantities of various carbohydrates and liming amounts of protein, minerals and vitamins
- **diary products**: abundant concentration of all nutritional components

### Nutritional requirements
From highest to lowest: 
- **Gram-positive bacteria** 
	- [[Listeria]], [[Staphylococcus]] and [[Clostridium]] spp.
	- have a tick cell wall with multiple layers of peptidoglycan & no outer membrane
	- need to acquire much of their necessary nutrients from the environment
- yeast
- Gram-negative bacteria 
	- [[Escherichia coli]], [[Salmonella]] and [[Campylobacter]] spp.
	- thin wall made from a single peptidoglycan layer, have an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
	- can synthesize a portion of their own nutrients 
- Molds 
	- can synthesize a portion of their own nutrients

## 3. Source of energy (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids)
- carbohydrates: 
	- simple carbohydrates: glucose, sucrose, lactose
	- complex carbohydrates: starches &cellulose
- alcohols
- amino acids
- proteins: casein
- lipids 

- The ability to use these complexes as an energy source is achieved through production of extracellular enzymes which can hydrolyze the compounds to a simpler form outside of the cells, allowing for their transport into the cell -> most commonly in molds 
- intracellular enzymes capable of converting large compounds into simpler forms can be released during cell death and lysis -> allows for a mixed population within the same food environment 
- microorganisms which are not able to produce their own extracellular enzymes can utilize the product from reactions of lysed intracellular enzymes (Jay et al. 2005, Ray and Bhunia 2008)

## 4. Source of nitrogen (amino acids and nucleotides)
- Nitrogen source is required by microorganisms for the synthesis of amino acids, proteins, [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and RNA 
- As a nitrogen source, amino acids are most frequently utilized, but other components such as nucleotides, peptides and proteins can also be metabolized

## 5. Minerals
- small amount of elements such as phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, sulfur, manganese and potassium are required for cellular metabolism -> are usually available within a food system

## 6. Vitamins 
- B vitamins are also required -> present at sufficient quantities in within most food sytems
	- Gram-positive bacteria tend to require B-vitamins in their environment
	- gram-negative bacteria & molds are able to synthesize them through their own processes
