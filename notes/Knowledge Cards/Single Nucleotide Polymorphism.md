SNPs are the most basic form of genetic variation among individuals. They occur when a single [[nucleotide]] (A, T, C, or G) in the [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] sequence is altered. This change can influence how genes are expressed and how they function, potentially affecting an individual's traits, disease susceptibility, and response to medications.
