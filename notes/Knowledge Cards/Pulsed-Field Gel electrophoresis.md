technique to separate large [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] fragments based on size

# Method
- **Electric Field Application**: When an electric field is applied across the gel, DNA fragments, which are negatively charged due to their phosphate backbone, move towards the positively charged electrode
	- **Alternating Electric Field**: Key to PFGE's effectiveness, allowing large DNA fragments to reorient and migrate efficiently through the gel, overcoming limitations of standard electrophoresis
- **Gel Matrix**: The gel (usually made of agarose or polyacrylamide) acts as a sieve, separating DNA fragments based on their size. Smaller fragments move through the gel more easily and therefore migrate faster and further than larger fragments.
- **Migration Pattern**: The result is a pattern of DNA bands across the gel, with each band representing fragments of a specific size. This pattern can be visualized and analyzed after staining the gel with a DNA-binding dye.

It has been the gold standard for many years and is good for distinguishing between strains of the same species, but its resolution is lower compared to [[Whole Genome Sequencing|WGS]]
