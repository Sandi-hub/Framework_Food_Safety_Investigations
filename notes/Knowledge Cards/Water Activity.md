# Water Activity 
- What is water activity, how is it measured


- the water requirements of microorganisms are described in reference to the water activity ($a_w$) in the food system 
- water activity = the ratio of the water vapor pressure (i.e. the pressure that vaporized water molecules produce) of food substrate tot he vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature 

- majority of fresh produce have $a_w > 0.99$ 
- majority of low-moisture food have $a_w < 0.60$ 
- shelf-stable food: $0.60 < a_w < 0.85$ 


- most spoilage bacterial do not grow below $a_w = 0.91$ and most do not persist below $a_w = 0.85$ 
- common spoilage bacteria: Pseudomonas spp., Lactobacillus spp., Flavobacterium spp., 
- Halophilic bacteria such as some Vibrio spp. and Micrococus spp. may grow and spoil food products with high salt concentrations (e.g. salted fish) at $a_w = 0.75$ 
- yeasts and molds can grow at $a_w = 0.61$
