# Source Attribution
> Source attribution has generally large uncertainties, but especially for listeriosis, source attribution is difficult due to the long incubation time of the disease [@foodandagricultureorganizationfao.worldhealthorganizationwho2022]

# Species
- Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) refers to a specific species within the Listeria genus.
- It is the most well-known and significant species in terms of human disease. Listeria monocytogenes is responsible for the infection listeriosis, which can be particularly severe in pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems.

# Food Safety Investigations
[Becker et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00003-021-01336-y)
The creation of epidemiological evidence from questionnaires and epidemiological studies for outbreak clarification by public health facilities is difficult due to the following reasons:
1. The attack rate is low and incubation periods can be long, especially for pregnancy associated cases (Goulet et al. 2013: *Goulet V, King LA, Vaillant V, de Valk H (2013) What is the incubation period for listeriosis? BMC Infect Dis 13(1):1–7._ https:// doi.org/ 10. 1186/ 1471- 2334- 13- 11*
2.  Morbidity and mortality of listeriosis cases contribute to the limited success of questionnaires as patients or their relatives cannot remember details about foods consumed during the possible time of exposure (Kiefer et al. 2016) _Kiefer S, Kling K, Stephan R, Bratschi MW, Jost M, Bless PJ, Schmutz C, Mäusezahl D, Wyss K, Mäusezahl-Feuz M, Hatz C (2016) How can patients and their physicians contribute to an outbreak investigation?
