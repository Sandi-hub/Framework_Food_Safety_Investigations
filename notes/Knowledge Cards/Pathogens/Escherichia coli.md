| Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) | - produce toxins known as Shiga toxins which are responsible for causing serious illness in humans<br>- most well-known STEC strain is **E. coli O157:H7**; but there are many other STEC strains (sometimes referred to as "non-O157 STEC") that can also cause illness<br><br>- STEC caused more than 1 million illnesses, resulting in more than 100 deaths and nearly 12 000 DALYs [@worldhealthorganizationwho2015] |
| Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)                | leading cause of traveler's diarrhea and are characterized by their production of enterotoxins, which stimulate the lining of the intestines causing fluid secretion and diarrhea                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
