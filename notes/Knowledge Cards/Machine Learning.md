# ML-Models
There is two main categories of machine learning: 
## Supervised Learning 
- using labeled data
- model learns using a training dataset and utilizes a testing dataset for performance evaluation

### Random Forest (RF)
### Logit Boost
### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
### Multinomial logistic regression (ML)
multiclass classification algorithm
## Unsupervised Learning
- using not labeled data

# Hyperparameter Tuning
- For optimal model hyperparameter tuning and establishing a more robust and unbiased model development process, it is recommended to perform validation procedures, such as cross-validation
