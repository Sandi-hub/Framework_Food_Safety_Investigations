- Due to **underreporting** or unknown agents (underdiagnosis) the burden is potentially much higher [@scallan.etal2011]

- If trends like large-scale production practices and distribution over ever-larger distances continue, the consequences of these outbreaks will become even more dire

# Worldwide
- 31 foodborne hazards (28 microbial pathogens and 3 chemicals) caused 600 million foodborne illnesses and 420,000 deaths in 2010. 
  [@havelaar.etal2015; @worldhealthorganizationwho2015] 
- complexity and globalization of food production have made foodborne disease a widespread public health problem in both developed and developing countries 

# United States
## Health Burden
48 million illnesses, 128,000 hospitalizations & 3,000 deaths annually
![[image-2-x32-y624.png]]
[@centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdc2018]
- 31 major foodborne pathogens are estimated to cause 9.4 million illnesses 55,961 hospitalizations and 1,351 deaths annually [@scallan.etal2011]
- Unspecific agents caused an estimated 38.4 million illnesses, 71,878 hospitalizations and 1,686 deaths [@scallan.etal2011a]

- Although most foodborne illnesses that occur in the US are not associated with recognized outbreaks, about 1,000 foodborne illness outbreaks are identified and investigated each year [@nuzzo.etal2013]
## Economic burden
- 2013 USD 15.5 billion for the 15 leading foodborne pathogens [@hoffmann.etal2015] 
- 2018 USD 17.6 billion for the 15 leading foodborne pathogens [@hoffmann.ahn2021]

# Europe
A causative agent (pathogen) was identified in 53.9% of all [[Foodborne Diseases|foodborne disease outbreaks]] in the EU in 2022 (3104 / 5763) [@europeanfoodsafetyauthorityefsa.europeancentrefordiseasepreventionandcontrolecdc2023]

‚ùì I do not understand the information on the implicated food item. [@buytaers.etal2024] claim that in 60% of foodborne outbreaks notified in the EU, the food source cannot be determined, citing [@efsa.ecdc2022], but I couldn't verify this information
