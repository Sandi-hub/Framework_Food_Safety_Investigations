Small, circular, double-stranded [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] molecules, distinct from a cell's chromosomal DNA, found in bacteria and some yeasts. Plasmids can replicate independently and are used in genetic engineering to introduce new genes into a cell, conferring beneficial traits such as antibiotic resistance or metabolic capabilities.
