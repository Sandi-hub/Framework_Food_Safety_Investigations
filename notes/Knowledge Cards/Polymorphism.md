illustrate the genetic variations within a population, i.e. the presence of two or more distinct forms ([[Allele|alleles]]) at a specific locus in a population's [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] . Polymorphisms can involve variations in single nucleotides (as in [[Single Nucleotide Polymorphism|SNPs]]), larger DNA segments, or even the presence of variable numbers of repetitive sequences in a gene.  
These variations are pivotal in determining differences in appearance, physiology, and disease susceptibility among individuals in a species. They are often stable and occur in significant proportions of the population. Two techniques  to study and map these polymorphisms in detail are [[Genotypic typing methods#Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP)|RFLP]] and [[Genotypic typing methods#Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP)|AFLP]].
