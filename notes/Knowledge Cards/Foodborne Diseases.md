❓What about yeast, molds and prions?

# Definition

A **foodborne disease** is any disease of an infectious or toxic nature caused by consumption of food [@worldhealthorganizationwho2008]. They can originate from different sources, including animals, i.e. [[Zoonoses]] or plants.

> “Along the food supply chain, food products may become contaminated with various **types of safety hazards**, including - **biological hazards** (e.g., bacteria, viruses, and parasites, prions) - **chemical hazards** (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides, and mycotoxins) - **physical hazards** (e.g., metal fragments and pieces of glass)
> (van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2015)”
> [@wang.etal2022], [Food safety (who.int)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/food-safety)

The illness can be caused by the microorganism itself (e.g., [[Pathogens/Salmonella|Salmonella]]), or by the toxins produced by the microorganism (e.g., Bacillus cereus, [[Pathogens/Staphylococcus|Staphylococcus]] aureus)

# Foodborne Disease Outbreak

> For the term "**foodborne disease outbreak**" various definitions are in use:
> a) The observed number of cases of a particular disease exceeds the expected number.
> b) The occurrence of two or more cases of a similar foodborne disease resulting from the ingestion of a common food.
> [@worldhealthorganizationwho2008] > _European Parliament and the Council. Directive 2003/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC and repealing Council Directive 92/117/EEC. Available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX %3A32003L0099 (Accessed 1 October 2019)._

Foodborne diseases remain a global public health challenge with significant burden [[Burden of Foodborne Diseases]], because [@sarno.etal2021]

- increased **susceptibility** of the general Population (e.g., elderly or immunocompromised people), leading to more severe illness outcomes
- increased spread of **antibiotic resistance**, as observed recently in human and animal isolates of [[Pathogens/Salmonella|Salmonella]] and [[Pathogens/Campylobacter|Campylobacter]]
  [@sarno.etal2021] citing _European Food Safety Authority and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 2020. The European Union Summary Report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food in 2017/2018. EFSA J. 18:6007. https:// doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2020.6007_
- **globalization** of food supply chains, which lead to large-scale distribution of food items and the potential for spread of pathogens

What also plays a role: [@sarno.etal2021] citing [@worldhealthorganizationwho2008]

- movement of people
- new consumption habits
- changes in virulence of known pathogens

# Pathogens

Leading pathogens can be categorized by causing most illnesses, most hospitalizations or most death, see [[Burden of Foodborne Diseases|burden of foodborne diseases]]. The burden of FBD is estimated in multiple studies for different regional scopes, years and using different methods.
