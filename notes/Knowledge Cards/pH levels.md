## What is pH Value?
- measure of a substance's acidity or alkalinity
- negative logarithm of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution
- pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, 
	- pH value = 7: neutral
	- pH values < 7: acidic
	- pH values > 7 basic (or alkaline)

- many bacteria grow in the pH range of 2.0 - 10.0
	- gram-negative bacteria are
	- more sensitive to extreme pH levels compared to gram-positive bacteria (Mendonca et al. 1994, Ray and Bhunia 2008)  
- many yeasts and molds grow in the pH range of 2.0-10.0
- Optimum growth of most microorganisms is observed around neutral pH levels (e..g 6.6 - 7.5)

- Lactobacillus spp. can grow at pH levels as low as 2.8, associated with the production of yogurt through fermentation of milk by various lactic acid bacteria

Food products can be grouped into high-acid (pH below 4.6) and low-acid (pH above 4.6) foods. 
- based on the ability of the foodborne pathogen Clostridium botulinum to grow at the lower limit of pH 4.6.
- high-acid foods: fruits, fruit juices, salad dressings and fermented foods
- low-acid foods: most vegetables, meats fish, breads and milk 
	- even though a product is considered low-acid, the majority of low-acid foods are still below pH 7.0
