Data collected from one store or restaurant during outbreak investigations. 
# Receipts
## @zenner.etal2014
using till receipts in [[Case-Crossover Studies|case-crossover study]] design to test the a priori hypotheses that rotisserie chicken was the causal food source in a specific takeaway restaurant

 **Advantages & Limitations**
 - [p] “Till receipts contain readily available data, which are cheap, quick, accessible, and of good quality.
     (accurate and unbiased)” @zenner.etal2014, p. 6
     - Information bias were largely avoided by use of purchase information” @zenner.etal2014, p. 7
 - [p] case-crossover design “minimises the potential for selection bias” @zenner.etal2014, p. 7
 - [c]  data accessibility
 - [c]  “sales data is not direct exposure/ consumption data” @zenner.etal2014, p. 6
 - [c]  data quality & completeness
	 - “sales descriptions were not available for 25% of the sales (miscellaneous category).” @zenner.etal2014, p. 7 -> were estimated based on price
     - No information on illness or demography of all the customers was available and cases were included within the cohort.” @zenner.etal2014, p. 7
 - [c]  more complex analysis -> “potentially limiting the number of exposures that can be analysed” @zenner.etal2014, p. 7
 - [c]  “Results can be biased if control periods are not representative of the expected distribution of exposure for follow-up times that do not result in a case” @zenner.etal2014, p. 7-8

## @waroux.etal2012
suggest that when a foodborne outbreak is linked to a restaurant, where no customers’ list is available, a [[Case-Cohort Studies|case-cohort study]] could be performed, in which meal consumption in the cohort of customers (e.g. based on receipts or any other type of restaurant record) would be compared to meal consumption in cases 

**Advantages & Limitations**
- [p] rapid test of hypotheses, with no need of selection and interviewing controls (particularly useful during ongoing outbreaks where speed is crucial)
- [c]  lack of adjustment for the possible confounding effects age and sex
- [c]  assumption that all food and drinks served were consumed


# Shopper Card Data 
Data from supermarket loyalty programs can provide detailed information on the purchasing habits of individuals 
@jervis.etal2019, p.1415
- background exposure data for [[Binomial Trial]] could be gleaned from store shopper card records. If a grocery chain could provide data about the percentage of shoppers who purchased a specific product over the course of a week in a given store or region, it could be used as the background exposure rate
- “This could be especially important for investigations of ‘‘miniclusters’’ involving five or fewer cases, for which the specificity of exposures needs to be granular enough to have an expected value less than 10%.” 

# Online orders
More fast-food and fast-casual restaurants are using online ordering platforms that can be used in a [[Binomial Trial]] @jervis.etal2019, p.1415
