For detailed insights into how different groups of microorganisms contribute to foodborne diseases, see the note on [[Knowledge Cards/Foodborne Diseases|foodborne pathogens]]. To understand how microorganisms are differentiated and identified, refer to the note on [[Typing methods for microorganisms]]
# Groups 
## Bacteria
- Single-celled organisms

## Viruses
[[Viruses]]

## Fungi 
Includes both single-celled yeasts and multicellular molds that can be beneficial or pathogenic

## Protozoa
Single-celled eukaryotes that can be free-living or parasitic

## Archaea
Single-celled organisms similar to bacteria but genetically distinct, often found in extreme environments

## Prions
Infectious proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases, distinct from other microorganisms due to the absence of nucleic acids.
