# Data Sources 
Exampels: 
- **Institutional Meal Records:** For outbreaks in settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, or schools, meal records can provide detailed information about food served and potentially consumed by individuals. These records are typically maintained by the institution's food service management. @haegebaert.etal2003
- [[POS Data]] In cases where individuals purchase food from retailers or restaurants, purchase receipts can be collected. @zenner.etal2014
