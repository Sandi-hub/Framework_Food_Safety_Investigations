In [[case-cohort studies]], a "Baseline Cohort Sample" refers to a random subset of the entire cohort at the beginning of the study period. This sample is taken from the initial population at risk, without knowing their future disease status, and is used as a control group for comparison against all identified cases over the course of the study.
