Usually, pathogens are identified by [[4 (Laboratory Testing)|laboratory testing]], which is time intensive. Therefore, you can also find out whether the outbreak was caused by an intoxication, an enteric infection or a generalized illness by looking at the symptoms @worldhealthorganizationwho2008. For this the percentage of cases with a particular symptom or sign is calculated an arranged in  table in decreasing order. You use the [[Clinical Features of Pathogen]] of the pathogens for this 

**Examples** @worldhealthorganizationwho2008
- predominant symptom vomiting without fever and the incubation period is short (less than 8 hours):
  intoxication by, for example, [[Staphylococcus]] aureus, [[Clostridium]] perfringens or Bacillus cereus is likely.
- Fever in the absence of vomiting and an incubation period of more than 18 hours:
  points to an enteric infection such as [[Salmonella]], [[Shigella]], [[Campylobacter]] or Yersinia 

**[[Machine Learning|ML]] for Pathogen identification**
“However, the [[Clinical Features of Pathogen|clinical features of foodborne diseases]] caused by different pathogens are not specific, and it is difficult to intuitively identify pathogens according to patient information and disease description.” @wang.etal2021, p. 2
- use "patient's age, patient's gender, home address, time of illness, symptoms, diagnosis, food name, and food type” of the cases to predict which pathogen is responsible
- since the food history is included as a feature it is not really so useful for the framework

There is in general methods to rapidly detect foodborne bacterial pathogens, but this is more for controlling and preventing human foodborne infections (surveillance) and testing foods and not for traceback
