## Food Categorization Scheme Problem

[@horn]
> - members of a commodities category may share cultivation and production processes, exposing them to contamination risks
> - Numerous commodity classification schemes exist, each tailored for different categorization purposes.
> - Identifying an effective system that sorts commodities based on their risk of sharing contamination causal factors requires extensive research

> “For [[Source Attribution Studies]] studies, it would be useful if harmonized food classification schemes (ontology) were used at the international level for the categorization/ typing of foods considered. This is complicated by the fact that for certain pathogens the specific source is more relevant (Campylobacter/poultry), while for others the consumption type is more relevant (Listeria/deli meat/RTE).” [@foodandagricultureorganizationfao.worldhealthorganizationwho2022]

### Existing Food Categorization Systems
 #### Framework by @painter.etal2009

Foods are grouped into categories (aquatic animals, land animals, and plants) with further subdivisions, which are used for source attribution studies and policy-making

- [c] new processing subcategories for larger food categories were needed @richardson.etal2017
- for example, separate categories for shell eggs (FDA-regulated) and pasteurized egg products (USDA-regulated)
- fruits and nuts were previously combined within a Fruits–Nuts category, but separate categories were needed. 
- The scheme also did not further classify Poultry foods into Chicken, Turkey, and Other Poultry categories useful for USDA-FSIS regulatory purposes. 
- It also did not indicate the manner in which some foods are processed, prepared, or consumed

##### Assignable and Unassignable Food
- Assignable Food: Implicated foods and ingredients that can be assigned to a single food category 
	- Food is assigned to one food category if it contains a single ingredient (e.g., apple and salmon) or if all ingredients in the food belonged to a single food category (e.g., salsa containing cilantro, tomato, and onion, which all belong to the broader Produce food category)
- Unassignable Foods: foods that could not be assigned to a single food category 
	- (1) Multiple-Ingredient Foods, defined as foods with multiple ingredients belonging to more than one food category (e.g., pizza and chicken salad) and 
	- (2) Unclassifiable Foods, defined as foods with uncertain ingredients (e.g., “buffet” and “ethnic food”)

#### EFSA FoodEx 2
comprehensive food classification and description system designed to support various activities within EFSA, such as exposure assessment and harmonization of food consumption data across Europe
