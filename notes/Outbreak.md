- Point Source Outbreak: all the exposures to the infectious agent or toxin occur within a brief, well-defined period of time. This might happen during an event, such as a meal at a restaurant where food contaminated with a pathogen is served, or through a single batch of tainted product that is consumed over a short duration.
- Continuous Source Outbreak: exposure to the infectious agent or toxin continues over an extended period. This might be due to a contaminated water supply, ongoing infection control issues in a healthcare setting, or prolonged availability of a contaminated food product in the market.
- Intermittent Source Outbreak: exposure to the infectious agent happens sporadically. This could be due to irregular releases of a contaminant or repeated issues at a facility producing or serving food. The epidemiological curve for these outbreaks might show several peaks corresponding to the times of exposure.
