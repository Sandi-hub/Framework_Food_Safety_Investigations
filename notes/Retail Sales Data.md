Encompasses sales data across all stores and products in a region, not limited to specific stores under investigation or specific products. In contrast, [[POS Data]] used in epidemiological studies are usually collected from one store or one restaurant and sometimes even only for certain products. This data can be used earlier in the investigation process, where hypotheses are generated rather than refined or confirmed. 

- [[@kaufman.etal2014]] use raw food sales data of the region under investigation to generate hypotheses about the contaminated food product
- @norstrom.etal2015 use detailed records of three food products (sausages from 3 different companies) including batch, and lot information, delivery and expiry dates, and the geographical distribution to municipalities
