The intrinsic and extrinsic factors within the physical, chemical and biological environments of food products influence the growth and resistance of microorganisms. 

# Intrinsic Factors
Factors that are innate to the food product itself

[[Composition of Foods]]
[[pH levels]]
[[Water Activity]]
[[Oxidation reduction (redox) potential]]
[[Antimicrobial Components]]
[[Biological Structures]]

# Extrinsic factors
Factors which are controlled through external conditions

- [[Temperature]]
- [[Relative Humidity]]
- [[Gaseous Environment]]
- [[Presence of other Microorganisms]]

this gets more important when we're in countries where there is not so much data
