- compares exposure levels in the same individuals at times near an event (risk period) to their [[Control Period Food Exposures|exposure levels at other times (control periods)]]
- Individuals serve as their own controls, which eliminates confounding variables related to differences between subjects
- design was first described by @maclure1991
- particularly suitable for continuous common source outbreaks where unbiased exposure information (e.g.  a menu or purchase records) is available 

# Advantages & Limitations
- [p] quicker & cheaper @haegebaert.etal2003
- [p] minimises the potential for selection bias @zenner.etal2014
- [p] since individuals act as their own controls, many biases related to individual differences in susceptibility or exposure are naturally controlled for @zenner.etal2014
- [c] Results can be biased if control periods are not representative of the expected distribution of exposure for follow-up times that do not result in a case” ( @zenner.etal2014, p. 7 - 8)

- [c] Difficult
    - “if precise (discrete) dates of exposure are not available”  ( @haegebaert.etal2003, p. 812)
    - “if investigators rely on the memory of patients, particularly when the incubation period is long” ( @haegebaert.etal2003, p. 812)
        - “bias towards better remembering foods eaten recently than foods eaten earlier” ( @haegebaert.etal2003, p. 812)
