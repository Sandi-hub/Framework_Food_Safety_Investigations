risk exposures are compared between cases with the outcome of interest and a randomly selected subcohort from the same population, with [[Baseline Cohort Sample|exposure data typically obtained from the entire cohort]]. In a caseâ€“cohort design, all cases (or a random sample of all cases) and a random sample of the source population (i.e. the controls) are included in the study. The controls may therefore include some of the cases included in the case group

Investigators gather data from all the people that attended an event or ate at the same restaurant and compare the frequency of illness between people who did and did not eat specific foods. When people who ate a certain food got sick significantly more often than people who did not eat the food, it provides evidence that the food is the source of the outbreak.
